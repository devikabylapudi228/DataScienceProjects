The Pupil Admissions Team receives all applications. Application forms \\nsent directly to schools are passed to the Pupil Admissions Team. All \\napplications received by schools should be date stamped. Those received \\nafter the closing date should be date stamped and marked ’Late’.  \\n4. Parents may return the supplementary information form (SIF) directly to \\nthe school concerned or to the LA.

Late \\napplications to voluntary aided or foundation schools or academies will be \\npassed to the relevant school(s) for late consideration and returned for an \\noffer to be made by the LA. \\n9. The Pupil Admissions Team reconciles all lists and determines the final \\noffer. If a child can be offered a place at more than one school, he/she will \\nbe offered a place at the school ranked higher in the preferences on the \\napplication. If none of the preferences can be met, a place will be offered \\nat the catchment school, where possible, or the nearest school to the \\nchild’s home with places available, if the catchment school is full.

All distances are measured by \\na straight line from the school to the child’s home address, using Ordnance \\nSurvey data within the curtilage of the property.  \\n• Where priority is given for a sibling, brothers or sisters may be half or \\nstepsiblings (by marriage or co-habitation) or foster siblings but must be \\nliving permanently at the same address.  \\n• West Sussex County Council only gives sibling priority if the older sibling will \\nbe at the school at the time of application and will still be in the school \\n(years 1-6 for primary and year 8-11 for secondary) at the time of \\nadmission; or if the sibling will be attending the linked junior school in \\nSeptember 2025.

To make the process as easy as possible, West Sussex County \\nCouncil encourages you to apply using the online application system at \\nwww.westsussex.gov.uk/admissions. \\nAll the information you need to help you through the process of applying for a school place \\nis in this booklet. Before completing your application, please take the time to read this \\nimportant information. The frequently asked questions pages and the admission \\narrangements for schools may help you decide on the best schools for your child. \\nBefore making your final decision about which schools to apply for, we would \\nstrongly encourage you to find out more about the schools you wish to consider. \\nMany schools have enhanced their web presence due to past Covid measures, with \\nvirtual tours and additional information being offered and this can be a useful source \\nof information for you. During the autumn term, schools will be providing \\nopportunities for prospective parents to find out more about the school and we \\nadvise you to contact schools to check their particular arrangements. \\nAlthough most children may secure a place at the first preference school, this is not \\nalways possible if there are more applications for a school than there are places \\navailable. When this happens, places will be offered by applying the oversubscription \\ncriteria. You are strongly advised to provide preferences for the three different \\nschools you would like your child to attend as this provides you with the best chance \\nof getting your child into a school of your choice. \\nWhere we are unable to meet one of your preferences, we will allocate a place at the \\ncatchment school where possible, or at the next nearest school to your home address \\nwhere there is space if the catchment school is full. Remember if you want your child to \\nattend their catchment school, you must include this as one of your preferences. \\nIt is really important that you apply by the national deadline of Monday 15 \\nJanuary 2024. Applying after this deadline may significantly affect the school that \\ncan be offered.  \\nI wish your son or daughter the very best for when they start at their new school. \\n \\nS\\nteve Nyakatawa \\nInterim Assistant Director of Education and Skills \\n  \\n'),\n",

Additional enquiries may also be made where necessary. \\nPriority for your preferences will be decided according to the address which the Pupil \\nAdmissions Team determines as your child’s main address.

Where parents cannot agree about their child’s educational arrangements \\nand cannot come to an agreement as to which school(s) to apply for then they may wish \\nto seek to have the dispute determined through the Family Courts. The Local Authority \\nand the Admission Authority will not mediate between parent disputes about school \\napplications. Where more than one application is received, the Local Authority or the \\nAdmission Authority will determine which application to process, this is normally \\ndetermined on the basis of the information detailed in the Child Benefit documentation, \\nthe address held by the current educational establishment, a council tax bill or medical \\nrecords. Additional enquiries may also be made where applicable. Please note that the \\nLocal Authority or Admission Authority will contact both applicants to advise that more \\nthan one application has been received.

However, the Team is unable to: \\n• offer opinions on schools’ suitability and performance; \\n• arrange visits to schools; \\n• allocate places outside West Sussex County Council’s criteria or take account of \\npersonal circumstances, outside of exceptional and compelling cases; \\n• change a child’s details (name or address) without written confirmation, by letter or \\nemail, and acceptable supporting documentation where appropriate; \\n• investigate anonymous allegations regarding false addresses without sufficient \\ninfo\\nrmation. West Sussex County Council does treat the issue of using a false \\naddress very seriously and any correspondence of this nature is dealt with \\nconfidentially. \\n \\nIf you are dissatisfied with the service of the Pupil Admissions Team, in the first instance \\nplease write to the Pupil Admissions Manager for the area, see page 98 and 100. \\nComplaints about schools should be referred to the headteacher or the school’s \\nGoverning Body. \\nHow likely is it that my preference will be met? \\nPlease see the section on using your three preferences wisely and being realistic (under \\n‘Points to consider before submitting your three preferences’) on page 6-8.

This is only a guide because patterns of parental preference and the number \\nof pupils in the area vary from year to year. The outcome of your application cannot be \\nguaranteed. If you want further information about the previous patterns of admission to \\nyour preferred schools, please contact the Pupil Admissions Team. \\nWhere can I find out information about schools? \\nIt is important that you do not base your preferences on other people’s opinions. Each \\nschool has a prospectus and website which include details of the school’s policies, \\nuniform, the curriculum and teaching methods, term dates and school times as well as \\nother helpful information. You can obtain a copy of the prospectus from the school and \\nyou are welcome to make an appointment to visit the school.

This information s hould also be available from the school or your \\nlocal library. \\nSchools may in vite you to attend an open session and this invitation or receipt of a \\nprospectus should not be seen as an offer of a school place as all offers are made \\nthrough the Local Authority. Headteachers may confirm that they would be happy to \\nhave your child in their school but again this is not an offer because all applications are \\nsubject to the admission criteria. \\nAre West Sussex Infant and Junior Schools linked? \\nWest Sussex infant and junior schools are linked (see the lists on pages 51 and 82). If a \\nstarting school child will have a sibling at the linked junior school in September 2024, \\nthen the starting school child has sibling priority for the infant school. Please note that it \\nis the parent’s responsibility to tell the Pupil Admissions Team about sibling links in their \\napplication. When making the infant school application online tick the box ‘Sibling will \\nattend this school or the linked junior school in September 2024 and complete the \\nrelevant section. \\nPlease note that if you are applying for a Year 3 place for one child at the linked junior \\nsch\\nool and a Reception place for a sibling at the linked infant school you must still advise \\nus of the sibling link on your younger child’s application even though an offer for the Year \\n3 place will not yet be confirmed. The Pupil Admissions Team will then check your \\napplications and ensure that the correct priority is given. If you do not advise us of the \\nsibling link on your application it may not be given and your younger child will be \\ndisadvantaged. If you require any clarification on the process please contact the Pupil \\nAdmissions Team who will be happy to advise you. \\nCan I ask for my child to go to any primary school in West Sussex? \\nYou can express a preference for any of the primary schools listed. West Sussex County \\nCouncil makes every effort to meet parental preference but some schools receive more \\napplications than the number of places available. When this happens, the \\noversubscription criteria are used to decide which children are offered a place.

In the case of church voluntary aided schools, the catchment \\narea may be defined in terms of parishes or deaneries while others may serve an even \\nwider area. For these schools, full details can be found in the school’s published \\nadmission arrangements on their website. Decisions to offer a place at these schools are \\nmade by the Governing Body or Academy Trust. \\nIf you apply for a place for your child at a community or controlled school that is not \\nthe catchment school for your address, you should note the following: \\n• the Council will not provide assistance with travel or related expenses to the school; \\n• it is less likely that places will be available at oversubscribed schools for any \\nbrothers or sisters, should you wish them to attend at a later date; \\n• the tie break for oversubscribed schools, within any oversubscription \\ncategory, is the straight line distance from home to school. \\n \\nCan I defer my child’s start at school? \\nBy law, children must start their full-time education in the term following their fifth \\nbirthday. In West Sussex your child may start either full or part-time in the September \\nfollowing their fourth birthday. All applicants seeking admission during the academic year \\ncommencing in September 2024 must apply by the deadline 15 January 2024. \\nWhen you have received the offer of a school place, you may wish to take the \\nopportu\\nnity to discuss the school’s induction arrangements and your child’s start date \\nwith the school. You can defer admission until the start of the spring or summer term so \\nlong as your child has not reached compulsory school age. However, you must inform \\nthe school of this decision. \\nYou may feel that starting school in September 2024 is too early for your child and would \\nprefer them to remain at a pre-school group, playgroup or in a nursery school. Should \\nyour child attend school part-time as well as a nursery or playgroup part-time, your \\nNursery Education Grant funding will automatically transfer to the school. This means \\nyou will have to pay the full fees for the amount of time your child attends nursery, pre-\\nschool or playgroup. \\nShould you choose to defer your child’s start until the term following their fifth birthday; \\nthe school you have been offered will hold your child’s school place provided your child is \\nstill joining the school in the reception year. If your child was born between 1 April 2020 \\nand 31 August 2020 you can decide not to take up a school place until September 2025; \\nhowever a place will not be held in a Reception class and in most cases your child may \\nneed to join Year 1 upon their admission to school. Parents wishing to defer to Year 1 \\nmust approach the Pupil Admission Team in May 2024 to apply for a place but should be \\naware that a place may not be available in a local school.

However, some parents wish to request a delayed admission and apply to start \\nschool in September 2025. \\nHowever, there is still no automatic right to a child being able to start in reception class \\nwhere that is not their normal age group. Parents therefore, should consider whether to \\nrequest admission out of the normal year group at all their preferred schools, rather than \\njust their first preference school. \\nThe decision lies with the relevant admission authority. For community and controlled \\nschools this is West Sussex County Council, for an academy it is the academy trust and \\nfor a foundation or voluntary aided school it is the governing body. In order for the \\nCouncil to make a decision, parents should complete the delayed entry application form \\nbelow before the closing date of 15 January 2024, and include any available evidence \\nfrom professionals detailing why there is a need for their child to start in the Reception \\nclass the following year. \\nIf a parent is applying for a school for which the Council is not the admissions authority \\nthey must contact the school direct. If the request is agreed, evidence from the school at \\nthe time of application will be required. One admission authority cannot be required to \\nhonor a decision made by another admission authority on admission out of the normal \\nage group. \\nYou must also complete an application, by 15 January 2024, for the admission of your \\nchild for September 2024. This will ensure that you have secured a school place for \\nSeptember 2024, which can be released later if the decision is made for your child to \\ndelay entry until 2025. \\nIf your application for delayed entry is agreed your child will not be allocated a place at a \\nschool for 2024 (or any place already offered will be released) and you will need to make \\na fresh application for a school place with those children starting school in September \\n2025. Parents should note that it will not be possible to apply online for a school place \\noutside of your child’s normal year of entry and you will need to contact the Pupil \\nAdmissions Team to request a paper application form in the Autumn Term 2024. The \\napplication will be considered in line with the published admission arrangements for the \\nschool alongside all other applications for September 2025. \\nIf your application for delayed entry is refused, your child must either take up the place \\nthey have been offered for 2024 by the start of the summer term 2025 or you must \\nmake an application for a Year 1 place in September 2025. Applications for Year 1 can be \\nmade in June 2024 for a September start.

On rare occasions, if school allocations overlap with your child being assessed for \\nan EHCP, you may receive an allocation from the Pupil Admissions Team which is \\ndifferent to the school you were expecting. \\nShould this happen please contact SENAT for advice; your child will be offered the school \\nmost appropriate to meet their needs. \\nWhilst we aim to meet parent requests where possible, it is the Council’s responsibility to \\nensure placements are appropriate and are an efficient use of resources. Only children \\nwith an EHCP/draft EHCP can apply for a place at a special school or a special support \\ncentre attached to a mainstream school. \\nIf your child has an EHCP/draft EHCP and you have any queries about the admission \\nprocess, please contact SENAT using the following telephone numbers: \\nSOUTH: Chichester, Bognor Regis, Midhurst, Petworth, Worthing, Steyning, Littlehampton, \\nAngmering, Shoreham, Portslade and Hove \\nTelephone: 0330 222 3120 \\nEmail: SENAT.South@westsussex.gov.uk \\n \\nNORTH: Crawley, Horsham, Burgess Hill, Cuckfield, East Grinstead and Haywards \\nHeath Telephone: 0330 222 2722 \\nEmail: SENAT.North@westsussex.gov.uk \\n \\nPlease only contact SENAT if your child has an EHCP/draft EHCP; for all other \\nchildren admissions queries should be directed to the Pupil Admissions Team. \\nHow do I apply to a church aided school or academy with a religious \\ncharacter?

Parents living in England outside of West Sussex can apply for a school in this \\ncounty but must do so by applying via their own Local Authority. This is the Local \\nAuthority for the county or city in which you live (telephone numbers for neighboring \\nLocal Authorities are at the back of this booklet). \\n \\nYou may wish to contact the Local Authority for your home to discuss the implications of \\nlisting a West Sussex school as a preference. Your home Local Authority will let us know \\nabout your application. Once decisions have been made we will inform your home Local \\nAuthority and they will notify you on 16 April 2024.

This is called Elective Home \\nEducation. It is important that the Pupil Admissions Team is aware of your plans, so that \\na place is not allocated unnecessarily for your child. Please confirm these alternative \\narrangements to the Pupil Admissions Team in writing. Your child will not then be \\nallocated a school place. Please do not list Elective Home Education as a preference on an \\napplication as it will be disregarded and a school place offered. Please note that if you \\nchoose to educate your child yourself you do not receive any additional priority for a \\nschool place should you wish to apply at a later date. \\nInformation regarding home education is available from West Sussex County Council’s \\nElective Home Education Team on 0330 222 3300 or by e-mailing ehe@westsussex.gov.uk. \\nMy child will be attending an independent school – do I still need to \\ncomplete an application? \\nIf you have received a confirmed offer of a place for your child at an independent school '),\n",

Only your last submitted preferences, prior to the deadline, will be \\nconsidered in the allocation. \\nAfter the deadline has passed you cannot change your preferences unless there is a \\ngenuin\\ne unforeseeable reason for you needing to do so, for example, if a sibling has \\nmoved schools. Evidence of the change will be required before the processing deadline of \\n9 February 2024 for the Pupil Admissions Team to amend your preferences and any other \\nrelevant information linked to your application. \\nParents wishing to change their preferences after the deadline without a genuine \\nunforeseeable reason cannot submit new preferences until after the allocation date. At \\nthat time parents should complete a new application through our website. Changes of \\npreference in this instance are outside the normal admissions round, and along with late \\napplications, will not be processed until after 15 May 2024. \\nHow will I hear the outcome of my application? \\nIf you apply on or before 9 February 2024, and supply an email address, you will be sent \\nan email on allocation day 16 April 2024 to confirm the outcome of your application.

(This only applies to children resident in West Sussex. If \\nyou live in another Local Authority’s area they will offer you a place at one of their \\nschools, if your preferences cannot be met). For this reason we always advise parents to \\ninclude their child’s catchment school as one of their three preferences. If you are \\nunhappy with the school you have been offered the Pupil Admissions Team can tell you \\nwhich alternative schools have places available but you should be aware these may be \\nfurther from your home than the offer you currently have. Please note that we have a \\nstatutory obligation to offer your child a school place and, therefore, we will not \\nwithdraw the place offered until we receive written confirmation, by letter or email, of \\nthe alternative arrangements you have made for your child’s education once they reach \\nstatutory school age. \\nCan I appeal? \\nYou have the right to appeal against the decision not to offer a place at any of your \\npreferred schools. All appeals are heard by an independent panel. If you have been \\nrefused a place in West Sussex at your preferred school(s) in writing, you can access an \\nonline appeal form and details of the appeals process at make an admissions appeal. If \\nyou require a paper form you can ring 03330 142 903 to request one. If you decide to \\nappeal, you will receive advance notice of the hearing date.

The hearing will be \\nconducted as informally as possible and you will have the opportunity to put forward \\nyour case and ask questions. \\nFor Reception, Year  1 and Year 2, the right of appeal is restricted by law due to Infant \\nClass Size legislation.

If you wish \\nyour child to be on the waiting list for a community or controlled school for the following \\nacademic year then you must submit a new application after 20 May of the academic \\nyear originally applied for.

This will only apply if an application was made for the catchment \\nschool and the place refused in writing. Please note that it is the parent’s \\nresponsibility to indicate these circumstances when applying for the younger \\nsibling’s school place. \\nStarting School Allocation: \\nAny child with an Education Health and Care Plan naming the school will automatically \\nbe admitted to that school, under section 324 of the Education Act 1996. \\n1.

The term ‘nearest’ is used in this document to mean ‘nearest suitable’.  There is \\nfurther information about transport and Educational Health & Care Plans (EHCPs) below. \\n \\nPreference and Transport \\nWhere a child attends a school which is not the nearest suitable or County Council catchment \\nschool on the grounds of parental preference, the parents are usually responsible for making \\ntheir own transport arrangements and for all transport costs.  The nature of the walking route is \\nnot taken into account where such a preference is made.  \\nParent/carers are able to express up to three preferences for schools in the \\nadmissions process.  If preferences for the three nearest schools are made in distance \\norder, nearest first, then transport assistance would be available to whichever school \\nis allocated as part of the admissions round.  This is because the school offered will \\nautomatically be the nearest available school.   \\nIf parents do not express their nearest suitable or catchment school as one of their preferences, \\nand instead request a place at a school which is not the nearest suitable or catchment school, \\nthe pupil will not be eligible for Council funded travel assistance unless the extended rights \\napply.

Through the implementation of the strategy the Local Authority \\nwill: \\n• Help to improve travel planning to schools and colleges \\n• Improve accessibility to schools and colleges \\n• Improve road safety and healthy lifestyles for children \\n• Continue to build on reduction of car use for school journeys \\n• Improve safety at school gates by discouraging illegal and inconsiderate \\nparking behaviors at drop-off and pick-up times \\n• Increase walking, cycling and using public transport to and from school \\n• Encourage independent travel for children and students with special educational needs. \\n \\nThe Strategy \\nThe strategy complements the West Sussex Transport Plan 2011-26 and draws from the Local \\nAuthority’s other plans and strategies including: \\n• Safer Routes to School delivery programme \\n• School Travel Plan programme (including behavioural change activities) \\n• Road Safety Framework 2016-2026 \\n• Walking and Cycling Strategy 2016-26 \\n• West Sussex Bus Strategy 2018-26 \\n• Home to School and College transport policies which are summarised in the Information \\nfor Parents Booklet and also available on the council’s website (see links below). \\nSchool Travel Plans \\nThrough the School Travel Plan Programme, the Local Authority is working alongside \\nschools to enable schools to develop and maintain an accredited Travel Plan. Travel \\nPlans are accredited through ModeShift Stars. School Travel Plans include advice for \\nparents about existing travel to school and plans for improvement. They should measure \\nand monitor the journey to and from school to help plan for future travel needs. School \\nTravel Plans are available either through the schools’ websites or by contacting schools \\ndirect. \\nWalking to school \\nThrough the development of the Walking and Cycling Strategy 2016-26, walking buses, \\nthe Safer Routes to School programme and other walking initiatives (e.g. walk to school '),\n",

As well as local information in some school travel plans, advice on \\ncycling in West Sussex can be found on the County Council’s website. The website also \\nlinks to the West Sussex Cycle Journey Planner (see the table below for links.) \\nSchools will have their own cycling policies and will also be able to advise on the facilities \\nthat they can offer, such as cycle racks and storage. \\nPublic Transport \\nThe Local Authority is committed to promoting the use of public transport. Information \\nabout rail and bus timetables, fares and travel planning can be found through the links \\nand contact points in the table below. \\nStudents who attend full-time courses at sixth forms, sixth form colleges or colleges of \\nfurther education can also get 50% off rail tickets (including season tickets) using the \\n16-17 Saver, a national scheme supported by the Department for Transport. This \\nreplaces the Sussex Student Card. \\nThe Local Authority works actively alongside bus operators to review existing and \\nimplement new bus infrastructure. \\nHelp with Home to School and College transport \\nIn the majority of cases, parents are responsible for their children’s travel and costs. \\nSome children and young people may be entitled to help with transport, depending on \\nthe school or college they attend and the distance between home and school. Individual \\ncircumstances may also be taken into account e.g. where a child or young person has \\nspecial educational needs or where the family is on low income. \\nFurther information about help with transport to and from school or college can be found \\non the school transport section of the council’s website. Additional information for \\nstudents attending sixth forms, sixth form colleges or colleges of further education can \\nbe found in the Post-16 Transport Policy Statement and its appendices published \\nannually on the website. \\nIndependent Travel Training \\nThe County Council is committed to the principles of inclusion and independent living for \\nchildren and young people with special needs and disabilities. The ability to travel \\nindependently is an important part of preparing children and young people for adulthood. \\nWhilst for some it will be difficult, many parents can help by using public transport with \\ntheir children as much as possible so that they get used to it as a normal mode of travel. \\nParents can help by training their children to use public transport independently as they \\nget older. Schools and colleges also help by offering independent travel training to help \\nchildren and young people achieve independent living outcomes in their Education, Health \\nand Care Plan.

If a child is coming from abroad to the \\nUK for the first time then the child must be in the country when you apply. However, if \\nthe child has previously lived in the UK, and you can prove that you are returning to a \\nproperty which you own or rent in West Sussex, then you can apply in advance of the \\nchild arriving in the country. If in doubt please contact the Pupil Admissions Team for \\nadvice. \\nIf you are thinking of changing schools because your child is not getting on at their \\ncur\\nrent school then you should always discuss your reasons for the move with the \\ncurrent school. If you remove your child from school and home educate for less than six \\nmonths your child will be expected to return to their previous school if there is space \\navailable. In-year applications will only be considered under the exceptional and \\ncompelling criteria at the time of the original application, unless there is an \\nunforeseeable change of circumstance after the application was made.

Online applications made at a weekend are \\ntreated as being received on the next working day. In-year applications for schools \\noutside West Sussex should be made direct to that school or Local Authority. \\nWhere West Sussex County Council processes applications, either as the Admissions \\nAuthority for the school or on behalf of the governing body of an own admission authority \\nschool, we aim to do so within ten school days of receipt, although this can be longer at \\nbusy times or if required information is delayed or complex. We can only offer a place if \\nthere are spaces in that year group and places for established year groups cannot be \\nreserved in advance. You can make an in-year application at any time and places \\nnormally have to be taken up within 10 school days. The exception is that in-year \\napplications for September entry (apart from the intake year) can be made from 20 May \\nand will be processed as if received on 1 June. In-year applications for September \\nreceived on or before 19 May will be returned to the applicant and must be resubmitted \\non or after 20 May.

Armed forces applications must be supported by an official \\nletter that declares a relocation date and a Unit postal address or quartering area \\naddress and it is this address that will be used when considering the application. There is \\nno guarantee that a place will be available at a preferred school; each application will be \\nconsidered in line with the school's admissions criteria.

Before applying for a state-funded school place it is the parent’s \\nresponsibility to ensure that they and their child have a right of abode in the UK or that \\nthe conditions of their immigration status otherwise permit them to access a state-\\nfunded school. You must provide evidence that your child is arriving in the UK within four \\nweeks of the application (usually a copy of your child’s flight ticket) and the address \\nwhere they will be living, if known. If a UK address is not provided the child’s current \\naddress abroad will be used which will generally give the lowest priority for a school \\nplace. All required evidence must accompany the application. Please do not send original \\ndocuments as these cannot be returned. If an offer is made and it transpires that these \\nconditions have not been met the offer will be withdrawn. \\nVulnerable Children – In accordan ce with the School Admissions Code, a Fair Access \\nProtocol exists to ensure that un-placed children, especially the most vulnerable, for \\nexample children who are homeless or children who are carers, are offered a place at a \\nsuitable school as quickly as possible. You will be contacted after you have returned an \\napplication form if your application is to be processed under the Fair Access Protocol. \\nLooked After Chi ldren and Previously Looked After Children - It should be noted \\nthat the School Admissions Code 2021 differentiates between a looked after child and a \\npreviously looked after child. A local authority has the power to direct a maintained \\nschool to admit a looked after child, even when the school is full. This is not the case \\nwith a previously looked after child, although previously looked after children do receive \\npriority under the oversubscription criteria. \\nInfant Class Size Legislation - Legislati on relating to Infant Class Sizes must be adhered \\nto. This means that classes for Recept ion, Year 1 and 2 must not contain more than 30 \\npupils with one teacher. In allocating places in these year  groups the Admission Authority \\nmust comply with this legislation as it is a statutory requirement and every effort must be \\nmade to keep over-sized classes to a minimum.

They are set up by sponsors from \\nbusiness, faith or voluntary groups in partnership with the Department for Education \\n(DfE) and the Local Authority. Academies are run by their own academy trust, which sets \\nthe admissions criteria and makes admissions decisions. \\nAdmission Authority \\nThe body that decides which children can attend a school, based  on their Admission \\nPolicy. For community and voluntary controlled schools this is the Local Authority. For \\nacademies, church voluntary aided schools, foundation schools and free schools, it is the \\nGoverning Body or Academy Trust. \\nBack-classing \\nThe Department for Education expects pupils to be educated in their correct \\nchronological year group. A back-classing arrangement is when a child who has already \\nbeen in receipt of education repeats an academic year and is therefore educated outside \\nof their chronological year group. This is an exceptional arrangement and applications \\nmust be supported by the current or most recent school. \\nCatchment School \\nThe school(s) that serve a specific area or address. \\nChildren of Staff \\nPriority will now be applied to children of school staff in either or both of the \\nfollowing circumstances (following section 1.39 of the School Admissions Code). \\n• Where the member of staff has been employed at the school for two or more \\nyears at the time which the admission to the school is made, and/or \\n• the member of staff is recruited to fill a vacant post for which there is a \\ndemonstrable skill shortage. \\n \\nChurch Voluntary Aided School \\nChurch voluntary aided schools are schools with a religious character which are run by \\ntheir own Governing Body, which sets the admissions criteria and makes admissions \\ndecisions. They are maintained by the Local Authority but the governing body contributes \\nto building and maintenance costs. \\nCommunity School \\nA community school is one which is funded and run by the Local Authority, who set \\nthe admi\\nssions criteria and makes decisions.

The school’s land and buildings are owned by the Governing \\nBody or by a charitable foundation or trust. \\nFree Schools \\nFree schools are a type of Academy. They are set up by local people/groups. They are \\nfunded by the Department for Education (DfE). Free schools are run by their own \\nacademy trust, which sets the admissions criteria and makes admissions decisions. \\nIndependent School \\nA school that charges fees and controls its own admissions, which are not co-ordinated \\nby the Local Authority.

The Nominated Person for WSCC  \\nThe nominated officer for Children Missing Education in West Sussex is Nikki \\nHumphrey, Senior Investigating Officer, Children Missing Education: 0330 \\n2222120 / CME@westsussex.gov.uk \\n3. Overview  \\n3.1 All children, regardless of their circumstances, are ent itled to a full-time \\neducation which is suitable to their age, ability,  aptitude and any special \\neducational needs they may have. Local authorities have a duty to establish, as \\nfar as it is possible to do so, the identity of children of compulsory school age who \\nare missing education (not on a school roll or in any other suitable provision) in \\ntheir area.  \\n3.2 Children missing education are children of compulsory school age who are not \\nregistered pupils at a school and are not receiving suitable education otherwise \\nthan at a school. Children missing education are at significant risk of \\nunderachieving, being victims of harm,  exploitation or radicalisation, and \\nbecoming NEET (not in education, employment or training) later in life.  \\n3.3 The law requires all schools to have an admission register and, with  the \\nexception of schools where all pupils are boarders, an attendance register. All \\npupils must be placed on both registers.  \\n'),\n",

Schools and colleges must be very \\nclear not to confuse this with children who may be missing out on education \\nthrough either poor attendance or truanting. For poor attendance and truanting \\nissues contact should be made in the first instance with Pupil Entitlement \\nInvestigations: 0330 2 228200 / PEI@westsussex.gov.uk; or if the school and \\ncollege consider the child with poor attendance or who is truanting to be at risk \\nthen contact should be made with MASH or for urgent cases, Police.  \\n4.

To make the process as easy as possible, West Sussex County \\nCouncil encourages you to apply using the online application system at \\nwww.westsussex.gov.uk/admissions\\nAll\\n the information you need to help you through the process of applying for a junior school \\nplace is in this booklet. Before completing your application, please take the time to read this \\nimportant information. The frequently asked questions pages and the admission arrangements \\nfor schools may help you decide on the best schools for your child. \\nBefore making your final decision about which schools to apply for, we would strongly \\nencourage         you to find out more about the schools you wish to consider. Many schools have \\nenhanced their web presence and this can be a useful source of information for you. During \\nthe autumn term, schools will be providing opportunities for prospective parents to find out \\nmore about the school and we advise         you to contact schools to check their particular \\narrangements. \\nAlthough most children may secure a place at the first preference junior school, this is not \\nalways possible if there are more applications for a school than there are places available. When \\nthis happens, places will be offered by applying the oversubscription criteria. You are strongly \\nadvised to provide preferences for the three junior schools you would like your child to attend as \\nthis provides you with the best chance of getting your child into a school of your choice. Where \\nwe are unable to meet one of your preferences, we will allocate a place at the catchment school \\nwhere possible, or at the next nearest school to your home address where there is space if the \\ncatchment school is full. Remember if you want your child to attend their catchment school, you \\nmust include this as one of your preferences.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nIt is\\n really important that you apply by the national deadline of Wednesday 15 January 2025. \\nApplying after this deadline may significantly affect the school that can be offered. \\nI wish your son or daughter the very best for when they start at their new school. \\nClaire Hayes \\nAssistant Director of Education and Skills  '),\n",

Paper forms will not be acknowledged. The most \\nsecure way is to apply online. Please note that the governors of church voluntary aided schools \\nand some academies ask parents to complete the school’s Supplementary Information Form \\n(SIF) by the same closing date. This extra information enables these schools to rank \\napplications correctly against their admissions criteria. SIFs can be found in Appendix 2 of this \\nbooklet and can be obtained from the school concerned. \\n \\n• 12 February 2025: Processing deadline for receipt of out of time applications made after the \\napplication deadline and receipt of evidence regarding a request to change preferences due to a \\ngenuine unforeseeable reason.

You must tick the appropriate box on the online application. \\nThe linked schools are shown on pages 26 & 28. \\nApplying for a primary school place for September 2025 \\nIf your child currently attends Year 2 in an infant school, and you would like them to attend Year \\n3 in a primary school in September 2025, you can make an In-year application from 20 May \\n2025 and if there is a space available they will be offered the place for September. Please see \\nthe sections ‘How do I apply for a Year 3 place for my child at a Primary School?’ on page 18 \\nand ‘In-year applications to join an established year group’ on page 35 for further information. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFrequently Asked Questions \\nWhat is the role of the Pupil Admissions Team? \\nThe role of the Pupil Admissions Team is to administer West Sussex County Council’s \\ncoordinated admissions scheme, including the allocation of places at community and voluntary \\ncontrolled junior schools in accordance with the Council’s published admission policy. The Team \\nis able to offer advice and guidance to parents making an application for their child. However, \\nthe Team is unable to: \\n• offer opinions on schools’ suitability and performance;  \\n• arrange visits to schools;  \\n• allocate places outside West Sussex County Council’s criteria or take account of \\npersonal circumstances, outside of exceptional and compelling cases; \\n• change a child’s details (name or address) without written confirmation, by letter or \\nemail, and supporting documentation where appropriate; \\n• investigate anonymous allegations regarding false addresses without sufficient \\ninformation. West Sussex County Council does treat the issue of using a false address \\nvery seriously and any correspondence of this nature is dealt with confidentially. \\nIf you are dissatisfied with the service of the Pupil Admissions Team, in the first instance please \\nwrite to the Pupil Admissions Manager for the area, see page 40. Complaints about schools \\nshould be referred to the headteacher or the school’s Governing Body. \\nHow likely is it that my preference will be met? \\n \\nPlease see the section on using your preferences wisely and being realistic (under ‘Points to '),\n",

The less priority you have under a \\nschool’s oversubscription criteria the less likely you are to be offered a place if that school has \\nmore applications than places. For the 2025 junior transfer round 99.5% of parents who applied \\non time were offered their preferred school and 100.0% were offered one of their three \\npreferred schools. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nT\\nhe table on pages 24-28 give details about the number of places offered and children refused \\nat each state-funded junior school in West Sussex for September 2024 admissions. This is only \\na guide because patterns of parental preference and the number of pupils in the area vary from \\nyear to year. The outcome of your application cannot be guaranteed. If you want further \\ninformation about the previous patterns of admission to your preferred schools, please contact \\nthe Pupil Admissions Team. \\nWhere can I find out information about schools? \\nIt is important that you do not base your preferences on other people’s opinions. Each school \\nhas a prospectus and website which include details of the school’s policies, uniform, the \\ncurriculum and teaching methods, term dates and school times as well as other helpful \\ninformation. You can obtain a copy of the prospectus from the school and you are welcome to \\nmake an appointment to visit the school. School websites can be accessed through the West \\nSussex County Council website. You can find links to school OFSTED reports and Department for \\nEducation performance tables by going to this Government website. This information should also \\nbe available from the school or your local library. \\nS\\nchools may invite you to attend an open session and this invitation or receipt of a prospectus \\nshould not be seen as an offer of a school place as all offers are made through the Local \\nAuthority. Headteachers may confirm that they would be happy to have your child in their \\nschool but again this is not an offer because all applications are subject to the admission \\ncriteria. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nAre West Sussex Infant and Junior Schools linked? \\nMany West Sussex infant and junior schools are linked (see the lists on pages 26 & 28). If a \\nchild applying for the junior school attends the linked infant school, then they have priority \\nunder the oversubscription criteria for the named junior school.  \\nCan I ask for my child to go to any junior school in West Sussex? \\nYou can express a preference for any of the junior schools listed on pages 24-28. West Sussex \\nCounty Council makes every effort to meet parental preference but some schools receive more \\napplications than the number of places available. When this happens, the oversubscription \\ncriteria are used to decide which children are offered a place. Please also see the answer to the \\nquestion ‘How likely is it that my preference will be met?’ on page 16 for further information, \\nand advice on using your preferences wisely and being realistic. \\nSchools are categorised as community, controlled, church aided (sometimes called voluntary \\naided) schools and academies. All community and voluntary controlled schools have catchment \\nareas and West Sussex County Council determine and manage the admissions. You can check \\nyour catchment school by entering your postcode on our website. '),\n",

In the case of church voluntary aided schools, the catchment area may be \\ndefined in terms of parishes or deaneries while others may serve an even wider area. For these \\nschools, full details can be found in the school’s published admission arrangements on their \\nwebsite. Decisions to offer a place at these schools are made by the Governing Body. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nIf\\n you apply for a place for your child at a community or controlled junior school that is not the \\ncatchment school for your address, you should note the following:  \\n• the Council will not provide assistance with travel or related expenses to the school;  \\n• it is less likely that places will be available at oversubscribed schools for any brothers or \\nsisters, should you wish them to attend at a later date;  \\n• the tie break for oversubscribed schools, within any oversubscription category, is the \\nstraight-line distance from home to school. \\nMy child currently attends a primary school, can I apply for year 3 in a \\njunior school now? \\nYou can apply now for a year 3 place in a junior school if your child currently attends a primary \\nschool. As the oversubscription criteria gives children attending a linked infant school priority, \\nyour chances of gaining a place if your child does not attend the linked infant school maybe \\nreduced. \\nHow do I apply for a year 3 place for my child at a Primary School? \\nIf your child is leaving an Infant school and you wish to apply for an all through primary school \\nrather than a junior school you must follow these steps: \\n• Apply online expressing a preference for a junior school by 15 January 2025. This will \\nensure that your child has a school place for September 2025 in case it is not possible \\nto offer a place at the primary school you prefer. \\n• You will be offered a junior school on 16 April 2025. \\n• You must then complete an In Year application from 20 May 2025 to confirm your in-\\nyear preference. If a place is available at your preferred primary school at this time, we \\nwill offer a place in June 2025 for September 2025 and withdraw the junior school \\nplace. If we cannot offer a place you will be advised of your right of appeal and the offer \\nof a place that you received on 16 April 2025 will remain. \\nIt is not possible to make an application for Year 3 at a primary school on your online application \\nor before 20 May 2025, this will be processed in June 2025.  \\n \\n \\nDo special rules apply to twins and multiple births? \\nA separate application must be made for every child. Please note that sibling priority is only \\ngiven when a sibling is already attending the school, therefore twins and multiple births do not \\ngive sibling priority to each other and their details should not be included as siblings on an \\napplication. Where West Sussex County Council is the Admissions Authority for the school and \\nthe last child to be offered a place is a twin, the other twin will normally be admitted over the \\npublished admission number. For schools that are their own admission authority please check \\ntheir policy directly with the school. \\nWhat if my child has special educational needs? '),\n",

You have a right to \\nmake a request for a school and you should already have been contacted by the Special \\nEducational Needs Assessment Team (SENAT). If not, please contact them using the contact \\ndetails shown below. SENAT try to arrange school admissions for children with EHCPs earlier in \\nthe year than other pupils to allow sufficient time to consider requests and for the necessary \\nconsultation process to take place. \\nIf your child is in the process of an Education, Health and Care Needs Assessment, you should \\ns\\ntill complete an application online with your mainstream school preferences. The Council will let \\nyou know whether an EHCP will be made and if a draft EHCP is issued you will be able to make a \\nrequest for the school you would like your child to attend at that time via SENAT. On rare \\noccasions, if school allocations overlap with your child being assessed for an EHCP, you may \\nreceive an allocation from the Pupil Admissions Team which is different to the school you were \\nexpecting. Should this happen please contact the SENAT for advice; your child will be offered \\nthe school most appropriate to meet their needs. \\nWhilst we aim to meet parent requests where possible, it is the Council’s responsibility to ensure \\nplacements are appropriate and are an efficient use of resources. Only children with an \\nEHCP/draft EHCP can apply for a place at a special school or a special support centre attached to \\na mainstream school. \\nIf your child has an EHCP/draft EHCP and you have any queries about the admission process, \\nplease contact SENAT using the following telephone numbers: \\nSOUTH: Chichester, Bognor Regis, Midhurst, Petworth, Worthing, Steyning, Littlehampton, \\nAngmering, Shoreham, Portslade and Hove \\nTelephone: 0330 222 3120 \\nEmail: SENAT.South@westsussex.gov.uk \\nNORTH: Crawley, Horsham, Burgess Hill, Cuckfield, East Grinstead and Haywards Heath \\nTelephone: 0330 222 2722 \\nEmail: SENAT.North@westsussex.gov.uk \\nPlease only contact SENAT if your child has an EHCP/draft EHCP; for all other children \\nadmissions queries should be directed to the Pupil Admissions Team. \\nHow do I apply to a church voluntary aided school or academy with a \\nreligious character? \\nYou apply to a church voluntary aided school or academy with a religious character in the same \\nway as you apply for a community or voluntary controlled school, foundation school or free \\nschool, i.e. you must complete an application through West Sussex County Council and return it \\nonline (applicants from outside West Sussex should follow their home Local Authority’s \\napplication process). \\n '),\n",

The policy is summarised below. \\nWhere h\\nelp with travel is agreed, it will be by one or more of the following, as appropriate: \\na) a free place on a contract or school bus; \\nb) a rail or bus season ticket; \\nc) a fuel allowance where travel by car is agreed; \\nd) by taxi, in exceptional cases only, usually for children with severe disabilities; or \\ne) a contribution towards the cost of travel. \\nTravel to the Catchment Area School or Nearest School \\nIf your child attends the County Council catchment school for your area, free travel will be \\navailable if your child is: \\n• of statutory school age and is under 8 years old and   \\n• lives two miles or more from their County Council catchment or nearest suitable school \\nor\\n  \\n \\n• i\\ns 8 years or over and \\n• lives three miles or more from their County Council catchment or nearest suitable school. \\nDistance is measured by the shortest available walking route. \\nAssistance will also be available where the school attended is not the catchment school but is \\nthe nearest suitable state-funded school to the home, provided the relevant walking distance \\ntest is met.  The term ‘nearest’ is used in this document to mean ‘nearest suitable’.  There is \\nfurther information about transport and Educational Health & Care Plans (EHCPs) below. \\nPreference and Transport \\nWhere a child attends a school which is not the nearest suitable or County Council catchment \\nschool on the grounds of parental preference, the parents are usually responsible for making \\ntheir own transport arrangements and for all transport costs.  The nature of the walking route is \\nnot taken into account where such a preference is made.  \\nParent/carers are able to express up to three preferences for schools in the \\nadmissions process.  If preferences for the three nearest schools are made in distance \\norder, nearest first, then transport assistance would be available to whichever school \\nis allocated as part of the admissions round.  This is because the school offered will \\nautomatically be the nearest available school.   \\nIf parents do not express their nearest suitable or catchment school as one of their preferences, \\nand instead request a place at a school which is not the nearest suitable or catchment school, \\nthe pupil will not be eligible for Council funded travel assistance unless the extended rights \\napply. \\n \\nParents should apply to the Transport Co-ordination team if they believe their child will be '),\n",

Through the implementation of the strategy the Local Authority will: \\n• Help to improve travel planning to schools and colleges \\n• Improve accessibility to schools and colleges \\n• Improve road safety and healthy lifestyles for children \\n• Continue to build on reduction of car use for school journeys \\n• Improve safety at school gates by discouraging illegal and inconsiderate parking \\nbehaviours at drop-off and pick-up times   \\n• Increase walking, cycling and using public transport to and from school \\n• Encourage independent travel for children and students with special educational needs. \\n \\n \\nThe Strategy \\nThe strategy complements the West Sussex Transport Plan 2011-26 and draws from the Local \\nAuthority’s other plans and strategies including: \\n• Safer Routes to School delivery programme \\n• School Travel Plan programme (including behavioural change activities)  \\n• Road Safety Framework 2016-2026 \\n• Walking and Cycling Strategy 2016-26 \\n• West Sussex Bus Strategy 2018-26 \\n• Home to School and College transport policies which are summarised in the Information \\nfor Parents Booklet and also available on the council’s website (see links below).

This includes pupils changing schools, pupils coming from a different \\ncountry or from other parts of the UK, pupils returning to a school from living elsewhere or \\nthose who have not been in school. If a child is coming from abroad to the UK for the first time \\nthen the child must be in the country when you apply. However, if the child has previously lived \\nin the UK, and you can prove that you are returning to a property which you own or rent in \\nWest Sussex, then you can apply in advance of the child arriving in the country. If in doubt \\nplease contact the Pupil Admissions Team for advice. \\n \\n \\n \\nIf\\n you are thinking of changing schools because your child is not getting on at their current \\nschool then you should always discuss your reasons for the move with the current school. If you \\nremove your child from school and home educate for less than six months your child will be \\nexpected to return to their previous school if there is space available. In-year applications will \\nonly be considered under the exceptional and compelling criteria at the time of the original \\napplication, unless there is an unforeseeable change of circumstance after the application was \\nmade. Therefore, supporting evidence from an independent professional (see page 12 above) \\nmust be submitted with the original application. \\nDetails of how to make an in-year application, which form to use and where to send it can be \\nfound at www.westsussex.gov.uk/admissions, or you can telephone 03330 142 903 for advice \\nand an application form. Online applications made at a weekend are treated as being received \\non the next working day. In-year applications for schools outside West Sussex should be made \\ndirect to that school or Local Authority. \\nWhere West Sussex County Council processes applications, either as the Admissions Authority \\nfor the school or on behalf of the governing body of an own admission authority school, we aim \\nto do so within ten school days of receipt, although this can be longer at busy times or if \\nrequired information is delayed or complex. We can only offer a place if there are spaces in that \\nyear group and places for established year groups cannot be reserved in advance. You can make \\nan in-year application at any time and places normally have to be taken up within 10 school \\ndays. The exception is that in-year applications for September entry (apart from the intake \\nyear) can be made from 20 May and will be processed as if received on 1 June. In-year \\napplications for September received on or before 19 May will be returned to the applicant and \\nmust be resubmitted on or after 20 May. Where preferences cannot be met parents will be \\nadvised of how to go on the waiting list and their right of appeal. \\n \\n \\nWhere West Sussex County Council does not process In Year applications on behalf of the \\ngoverning body of an own admission authority school, you need to contact the school direct.  It \\nshould be noted that schools that require completion of a Supplementary Information Form \\n(SIF), for example church voluntary aided schools or academies with a religious character, will \\nalso need this for an In Year application. \\nSpecial rules apply to in-year applications for the following groups of children: \\nService Personnel - West Sussex County Council is committed, in accordance with The Armed \\nForces Covenant, to ensuring that members of the Armed Forces Community suffer no \\ndisadvantage in accessing public services. Members of the armed forces with automatic right of \\nentry to the UK who are able to provide evidence of their relocation may apply for a school place \\nahead of a move. An application can be made as soon as confirmation of the relocation is \\navailable, with no restriction on how far in advance the application can be made. Armed forces \\napplications must be supported by an official letter that declares a relocation date and a Unit \\npos\\ntal address or quartering area address and it is this address that will be used when \\nconsidering the application.

An \\napplication can be made as soon as confirmation of the relocation is available, with no restriction \\non how far in advance the application can be made. For crown servants a United Kingdom \\naddress can only be used if there is evidence of the address the child is returning to. There is no \\nguarantee that a place will be available at a preferred school; each application will be considered \\nin line with the school's admissions criteria. \\nChi\\nldren coming from abroad - If a child is coming from abroad to the UK certain conditions \\nmust be met. Before applying for a state-funded school place it is the parent’s responsibility to \\nensure that they and their child have a right of abode in the UK or that the conditions of their \\nimmigration status otherwise permit them to access a state-funded school. You must provide \\nevidence that your child is arriving in the UK within four weeks of the application (usually a copy \\nof your child’s flight ticket) and the address where they will be living, if known. If a UK address \\nis not provided the child’s current address abroad will be used which will generally give the \\nlowest priority for a school place. All required evidence must accompany the application. Please \\ndo not send original documents as these cannot be returned. If an offer is made and it \\ntranspires that these conditions have not been met the offer will be withdrawn. \\nVulnerable Children –  In accordance with the School Admissions Code, a Fair Access Protocol \\nexists to ensure that un-placed children, especially the most vulnerable, for example children \\nwho are homeless or children who are carers, are offered a place at a suitable school as quickly \\nas possible. You will be contacted after you have returned an application form if your application \\nis to be processed under the Fair Access Protocol.  \\n \\n \\nLooked After Children and Previously Looked After Chi ldren - It should be noted that the \\nSchool Admissions Code 2021 differentiates between a looked after child and a previously \\nlooked after child. A local authority has the power to direct a maintained school to admit a \\nlooked after child, even when the school is full. This is not the case with a previously looked \\nafter child, although previously looked after children do receive priority under the \\noversubscription criteria. \\nCan I apply for admission outside my child’s normal age group? \\nParents may seek a place for their child outside of their normal age group. An application should \\nbe made to the Admission Authority for the school you wish to apply for. The decision will be \\nmade on the basis of the circumstances of each case and in the best interests of the child \\nconcerned. The right of appeal does not apply if a place is offered at the school but it is not in \\nthe preferred age group.

For academies, church \\nvoluntary aided schools, foundation schools and free schools, it is the Governing Body or \\nAcademy Trust. \\nBack-classing \\nThe Department for Education expects pupils to be educated in their correct chronological year \\ngroup. A back-classing arrangement is when a child who has already been in receipt of \\neducation repeats an academic year and is therefore educated outside of their chronological \\nyear group.

Details are \\nincluded on the Local Plans from each of the county’s District and Borough \\nCouncils as those documents directly influence the strategy on meeting \\nforecasted demand.  \\nWhilst the booklet is no longer a statutory document the Council considers it \\nimportant to set out its policies and principles underpinning school organisation \\nacross West Sussex as the Council holds the statutory responsibility to plan \\neducation provision. \\nThe booklet sets out the proposals, either for individual schools or school \\nplanning areas, both in the short term as well as the 15-year life span of the \\nLocal Plans of the District and Borough Councils.  I would encourage you to look \\nat the details not just for your own area but also across the county, as it \\nprovides a useful insight into the significant role that the County Council has in \\nplanning the strategic infrastructure. \\nThe public education system in West Sussex is no longer solely managed by the \\nCounty Council because of the county’s 286 schools and education settings over \\n42% are now Academies, Free Schools, Voluntary Aided or Trust Schools, who \\nare their own admissions authority, providing education to just over 50% of the \\ncurrent pupils of statutory school age. \\nDuring the last decade West Sussex experienced a sharp rise in the number of \\nbirths over those seen in the previous decade. Whilst the pace of this growth in \\nbirths has now stabilised, and in some areas is currently reducing, it still leaves \\nan overall trend of rising pupil numbers which require secondary school places in, \\ncreating a continuing basic need for additional school places. \\nThe County Council has responded to this need with a programme of school \\nexpansions, with very few areas of the county unaffected. In the last ten years, \\nthese additional school places have been provided, predominantly in the primary \\nsector and the Council is grateful to school leaders for their help and \\nencouragement in finding appropriate solutions across the county. As these \\nnumbers now move through to secondary phase we continue to work \\ncollaboratively with all school leaders across the county to provide additional \\nplaces either by way of bulge classes or permanent expansions.

Our aim is to do this in a way that raises standards, \\nmanages rising as well as declining pupil numbers, and creates a diverse \\ncommunity of schools. WSCC seeks to exercise this function in partnership with \\ndioceses, multi-academy trusts, governing bodies of schools, headteachers, local \\ncommunities and other key stakeholders. \\nThe need for school places changes in response to population movements and \\nbirth rate variations. Increases in demand can lead to the creation of a new \\nschool, or the expansion of existing schools by adding permanent or temporary \\naccommodation. \\nSurplus places can also mean the reduction of school provision in an area \\nthrough reduced admission arrangements or the rationalisation of school \\nprovision, including changes to existing catchment areas. Any review of school \\nprovision undertaken by the County Council, for example the opening, closing, \\nfederating, amalgamating, expanding or contracting of schools, will, in the main, \\nbe led by forecast pupil numbers. We are committed to ensuring that pupil places \\nbest match to pupil demand, wherever practicable. Predicting school place \\ndemand is a complex task. Where children go to school involves a range of \\nfactors such as housing growth, inward and outward migration and parental \\npreference. As a result, planning for school places is based on probabilities and \\nnot certainties and while pupil forecasts may be derived from sound \\nmethodology, they come without guarantees. Furthermore, the practice of school \\norganisation must consider several different, and at times conflicting, factors. \\nThis includes the need to: \\n• respond to local need, to raise standards, to promote diversity, or to\\nrespond to government policy;\\n• respond to external and internal findings on the quality of schools; and\\n• ensure that scarce resources are used efficiently.'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data-WordWizards/planning_school_places.pdf', 'page': 5}, page_content='Planning School Places 2024  Policy and Principles \\n© West Sussex County Council – Feb 2024 Page | 2 \\nS\\neveral schools have been expanded in recent years in response to rising \\ndemand for places. \\nThe established practice is to support sustainable expansion. Decisions on \\nexpansion take account of factors including the availability of resources for new \\nbuildings, the infrastructure of the existing school (halls, specialist facilities and \\nservices such as gas and electricity supply capacity), the size of the site, and \\ntransport implications. The quality of education and its sustainability are key \\nconsiderations. Other important strategic factors are the availability of places \\nlocally, set in the context of the likely pattern of future demand, modified where \\nappropriate through plans for known housing developments and migration. \\nNot all unfilled places in a school are surplus places. Some margin of capacity is \\nnecessary to allow parents to exercise a preference, account for any volatility in \\npreferences from one year to the next, and to allow for differences in the size of \\nindividual cohorts. The County Council’s position is that a school should be \\nconsidered as full when it has less than 5% of its places unfilled. This is in line \\nwith the National Audit Office report on Capital Funding for new school places \\npublished in 2013, where it states:  \\n“It considered that on average 5 per cent was the bare minimum \\nneeded for authorities to meet their statutory duty with operational \\nflexibility, while enabling parents to have some choice of schools”. \\nThe range of educational provision for children and young people is now both \\nbroad and complex in terms of the number of providers involved. Therefore, to \\naid understanding it may be helpful to consider provision in three phases: \\nAge 0-4 ‘early years’ in which private, voluntary and independent playgroups \\nand nursery schools are the main providers; \\nAge 4-16 ‘compulsory school age’ in which schools are the main providers; \\nAge 16-19 ‘further education’ in which colleges and school sixth forms both \\noffer substantial provision. N.B. this extends to age 25 for young \\npeople with SEND. \\nThis document will therefore form part of the family of plans and policies that \\nrelate to West Sussex. It will also facilitate the development of other plans and \\nstrategies for the delivery of schools and school places, and the replacement \\nand/or refurbishment of existing provision where necessary. It will link to the \\nforward planning of education provision in response to likely and known future \\nhouse building. A summary of the acronyms used, and any links referred to \\nwithin this document can be found in the glossary at the back of this document \\nstarting on page 116. \\nPlease Note - it is not a statutory requirement to produce this document. \\nHowever, we believe it is helpful to the local and national education system, \\nthat the data is openly shared. The accuracy of school place planning is \\ndependent on a multitude of demographic and economic factors, many of \\nwhich are beyond our control. We therefore request readers of this document \\naccept that all projections provided are best estimate based on current data at \\nthe time of publication. '),\n",

It will coordinate \\nresources in West Sussex to help children, young people and adult learners \\nthrough learning and employment and includes from early years to post 16 \\nprovision and adult community education. \\nSeven strategic themes set out our work and link to the whole Children, Young \\nPeople and Learning department and Our Council Plan 2021-25. \\nFull details can be found in the strategy linked below or in the glossary at the \\nback of this booklet: \\n• West Sussex Education and Learning Strategy 2023–2025 (PDF)\\nClass Sizes \\nWSCC has invested heavily, in both buildings and revenue funding, to ensure \\nthat only in exceptional and unavoidable circumstances, infant classes will \\ncontain more than 30 pupils.  All primary schools are resourced to allow average \\nclass sizes to be below 30.  However, the County Council believes that the \\norganisation of classes within schools should be determined by headteachers and \\ngovernors, who will wish to consider all factors appropriate to their own school in \\nestablishing their staffing and organisation within legislative constraints. In \\nsecondary schools the County Council resources secondary-age pupils in line with \\nthe average for English ‘Shire’ authorities and again recognises that the \\norganisation of individual schools is a matter for headteachers and governors to \\ndetermine locally. \\nAdmissions Policy \\nParents in West Sussex are invited to indicate up to three preferences when \\napplying for a school place for their child. The pattern of mobility across many \\nparts of the county is evidence that parental preference is met in a very high \\nproportion of cases. \\nFull details of the County Council’s admission policies are published on the \\nCounty Council website. Any questions you may have following National Offer \\nDay in April should be directed to the admissions teams at WSCC School Places. \\n• School effectiveness strategy (PDF)\\nThe governing bodies of voluntary aided church schools, academies and free \\nschools set the admissions criteria for their individual school.  In the case of \\nacademies, the ESFA requires that any changes to the admission policy, including \\nincreases in the number of sixth formers and the minimum number of external \\nplaces to be offered, must be in consultation with the Local Authority and other \\nproviders. \\nThe Greenwich Judgement affects schools close to the county boundary. In \\npractice, the Law requires the Local Authority to admit pupils no less favourably \\nand according to its admission criteria irrespective of the Local Authority in which \\nthey live.  '),\n",

Where a school has a catchment area, \\npriority is given to children who live within the catchment boundary however \\nbeing in a school’s catchment area does not guarantee a place at the catchment \\nschool. Parents who are refused a place at any of their preference schools are \\nautomatically added to a waiting list and offered the right of appeal. \\nIndependent Appeal Panel Members will consider the circumstances of each \\nindividual appellants circumstances alongside the circumstances of the preferred \\nschool before making their decision. \\nSummer Born Children \\nWSCC (in agreement with the majority of the South-East Regional Network \\nGroup) is taking the line that, until the consultation has been completed and the \\ncode changed, we will continue to act in accordance with the current code. This \\nrequires parents to apply to the relevant admission authority if they wish their \\nchild to be considered for delayed entry into reception. Each case will be \\nconsidered on its own merit and parents must demonstrate why it is in the child’s \\nbest interest to start in reception a year later, rather than being admitted directly \\ninto Year 1 with their chronological peers. \\nThe views of headteachers (and the educational psychologist where relevant) will \\nbe considered when making any decisions. \\nFinance \\nFunding for the provision of additional school places in community and voluntary \\ncontrolled schools is included in the County Council’s Capital Programme.

The prioritisation of spending is governed by the Asset Management \\nPlan and benefits from a review by headteacher representatives and officers, \\nprior to confirmation by the Cabinet Member for Children and Young People, \\nLearning and Skills.  \\nCapital work in Voluntary Aided Schools is, in approved cases, funded directly by \\nthe DfE to the value of 90% of the majority of costs, with the remaining 10% \\nbeing met by the school. \\nUnder the Government’s or Voluntary Aided schools’ legislation, new schools \\nmust be opened as free schools or academies and, only if no free school sponsor \\ncan be found, opened as Local Authority maintained schools.  In this instance, \\nfunding is made available from the DfE. \\nWhilst central Government separately funds new free schools and academies, it \\nalso provides some funding to Local Authorities from the Education and Skills \\nFunding Agency (ESFA) to cater for population growth. \\nThis funding is an un-ring-fenced capital grant and is available to contribute to \\nmeet the demand for additional school places.  There is also an expectation that \\nfunding will be obtained in the form of Section 106 Developer Contributions and \\nthrough the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). These contributions will form \\nan element of the financing of the County Council’s basic need programme for \\nthe provision of new school places.   \\nIn some circumstances, this will include the provision of new school sites with \\nthe developer building schools on behalf of the Local Authority, which would then \\nopen as academies and be managed by an academy sponsor. \\nTransport \\nFor children of compulsory school age, transport to school is provided in \\naccordance with the County Council’s statutory duty.  Pupils under the age of \\neight receive transport if they live more than two miles away from their \\ncatchment or nearest available school. Pupils over the age of eight receive \\ntransport if they live more than three miles away from their catchment or \\nnearest available school.  \\nPrimary age pupils over the age of eight from low-income families (where the \\nchild is eligible for free school meals, or where the family receives Working Tax \\nCredit at the maximum level for the case), receive transport if they are attending \\ntheir catchment or nearest available school.

There is a range of provision offered to meet these needs under \\ncommissioning arrangements with schools and the local authority. These include \\nblended learning, vocational training at a college of further education, planned \\nactivities with different appropriate provision settings, commissioned by schools \\nand/or placement in West Sussex Alternative Provision College (WSAPC), a Pupil \\nReferral Unit (PRU) and short stay school. There are 292 full time equivalent \\nplaces at the WSAPC although 16 of these are used to resource outreach \\nservices. \\nA further 109 full time places are commissioned with further education colleges \\nfor Key Stage 4 pupils who would benefit from a vocational pathway, a \\nproportion of these young people being at risk of exclusion. Of these, most \\nplaces are provided with a subsidy from the local authority. The remaining few \\nplaces are provided at full cost to the local authority for young people moving \\ninto West Sussex in year 11 and for whom this is deemed the most suitable \\neducation provision. \\nPlanning school places and area working \\nIn order to carry out effective pupil place planning in West Sussex, in line with \\nthe DfE’s requirements for pupil forecasting, capital spend, and school capacity is \\nsplit into school planning areas, sometimes referred to as locality groups of \\nschools. These are based on the geographical areas defined by the secondary \\nschools’ catchment area and the feeder schools aligned to them. There are \\ncurrently 26 school planning areas in West Sussex for primary provision and 18 \\nfor secondary, any changes to these areas are subject to approval by the \\nDepartment for Education.  Any decisions on changes to education provision \\nwithin a planning area, such as the expansion of one or more of these schools, \\nare discussed on a regular basis with the West Sussex School Effectiveness \\nService, headteachers, and where necessary, the relevant diocesan \\nrepresentatives and academy trusts. Further detailed information on any \\nproposed changes, or additional provision within these school planning areas, can \\nbe found in the District and Borough commentaries section of this document. \\nPlanning Primary Provision \\nProvision for children aged 4-11 at primary, infant and junior schools \\nOur guiding principles for primary schools are that, wherever possible: \\n• all-through primary schools (ages 4-11 years) should be established;\\n• schools should have a minimum of one form of entry (FE), 210 places,\\nand ideally no more than 3FE, 630 places, with recent guidance from\\nt\\nhe DfE suggesting new primary schools should ideally be no smaller\\nthan 2FE, 420 places; and\\n• the pattern of schools should ensure that a primary school is readily\\naccessible to its pupils and, in urban areas, within walking distance of\\nthe homes of the majority of its children, as detailed later under the\\nt\\nransport paragraph on page 6.'),\n",

In order to achieve the benefits of smaller schools we will: \\n• support the development of ‘schools within schools’ on existing sites; and\\n• consult on and agree research-based criteria and guidelines for planning\\n‘\\nschools within schools’.\\nWe will also encourage secondary schools in rural areas to make use of their \\nlinks with primary schools to extend their presence in local communities, and \\ntheir accessibility to parents/carers. \\nIn the case of secondary schools, the County Council would normally wish to see \\nschools operate at: \\n• A minimum of 6FE, 900 places, and ideally no more than 10FE, 1500\\nplaces;\\n• The County Council recognises that 4FE and 5FE secondary schools are\\ncurrently well established and operating successfully in West Sussex; and\\n• In planning terms, a form is 30 pupils, therefore, a 6FE 11-16 secondary\\nschool would have year groups of 180 and a total of 900 pupils on roll.\\nThe County Council supports a range of sixth forms, which reflect\\nindividual schools, and the areas they serve.\\nSpecial Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND) \\nThere are no final guidelines for the size of special schools. The size of special \\nschools relates to the age range and the type of special educational need. Where \\npupils present significant management difficulties special schools tend to be \\nsmaller. \\nShort-term and long-range forecasting methodology \\nTo cater for any increase in the pupil population the Local Authority may choose \\nto expand existing provision or, if demand from housing developments are of \\nsufficient size to support their own provision a new school will be established. In \\norder to fulfil its statutory duty, the local authority will have to follow the \\nrelevant legal process to either make a significant alteration to an existing \\nmainstream school or academy or establish a new school. A summary of the \\nprocesses can be found on pages 15 and 16. Full details can be found by \\nfollowing the link to the DfE website at the back of this booklet. \\nIn\\n forecasting future need, the County Council is reliant on accurate birth data \\nwhich is collected by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) by electoral ward. \\nData on pupil movement trends is collected from the School Census and \\n'),\n",

This is because, when it comes to \\napplying for a school place, parents/carers are under no obligation to apply for \\ntheir nearest school and could instead express a preference for a school outside \\nof their town, borough/district or county, or choose home schooling or \\nindependent provision for their child. \\nWhere possible, the County Council strives to meet parental preferences. \\nAnalysing historic pupil movement trends enables the planning of school places \\nto take preference patterns in an area into consideration, pupil planning has \\nhistorically been effective in this regard.  \\nFor September 2023 we were able to offer a place at a preferred school to:- \\nStarting School Primary 2023 \\n98.3% of those who applied were offered one of their three preferences, with \\n91.0% offered their first preference school, which is a slight decrease on the data \\nfor September 2022. \\nJunior Transfer 2023 \\n100% of one of their three preferences met, with 99.8% offered their first \\npreference school, which is a slight increase on the data for September 2022. \\nSecondary Transfer 2023 \\n96.1% of one of their three preferences met, with 86.4% offered their first \\npreference, this is a decrease on the data for September 2022. \\nLike many other Local Authorities across the country, we experienced a higher \\nthan predicted number of pupils requesting a place to transfer to secondary \\nschool for year 7 for September 2023. To help with this demand we, along with \\nthe help and support of the head teachers and principals were able to secure \\nadditional places at some of the secondary schools across the district and \\nboroughs served by West Sussex. \\nThis trend is continuing in some areas of the county and to date for September \\n2024 we have been able to secure additional places at some, if not all the \\nschools in the following district and boroughs \\nIn Adur we have secured a further 70 secondary places. \\nIn Arun we have secured a further 40 secondary places. \\nIn Chichester we have secured a further 38  secondary places. \\nIn Crawley we have secured a further 75 secondary places.

However, it should be \\nnoted that whilst there is not a prescribed ‘pre-publication’ consultation period \\nfor significant changes the guidance is very clear that “there is a strong \\nexpectation on councils to informally consult with interested parties in developing \\ntheir proposal prior to publication.” \\nStage 1\\n• Publication - S tatutory proposal(s) published\\nStage 2\\n• Representation - mus t be four weeks as prescribed in\\nregulations\\nStage 3\\n• Decision - th e decision maker (usually the Cabinet Member)\\nmust decide proposals within 2 months of the end of the\\nr\\nepresentation period.\\nStage 4\\n• Implementation - Mu st be by the date specified in the\\ns\\ntatutory proposal'),\n",

If this is approved, the local authority runs\\na competition to find the best provider to run the school. This requires you\\nto submit your application to both the local authority and the Department\\nfor Education (DfE), who will co-assess your application against set\\ncriteria.\\n• Local Authority presumption competition: The local authority\\npublishes a specification for a school and invite trusts to apply to run that\\nschool.

These \\nbroadly relate to the catchment areas serving clusters of secondary schools but \\ndo not match the school planning areas perfectly. However, for the purpose of \\nmonitoring pupil numbers and determining the basic need in a particular area, \\nthey provide the most helpful framework for pupil place planning at a strategic \\nlevel. Schools that are within a district/borough that do not correlate to the \\nplanning area are shown in the tables with their family group of schools. \\nThe information below is in two sections, short term (first five years) and longer \\nterm (up to 15 years) and sets out how WSCC is planning to provide for the \\nstatutory educational needs for pupils (aged 4-16) in primary and secondary \\nschools relating to each District and Borough Council area, incorporating the \\neight planning authorities. There is a greater level of certainty in the short term, \\nwith many of the proposed schemes already coming forward. However, this \\ndocument seeks to give an indication as to possible requirements, in order to \\nmitigate future planned development in the longer term. \\nWhilst the information provided concentrates on starting school years, Reception \\nfor primary and infant schools, Year 3 for junior schools and Year 7 for \\nsecondary, it is recognised that pupils can apply to be admitted to any year \\ngroup at any time throughout the academic year. \\nFunding to support these projects will include Government grants and \\ncontributions from developers.  \\nDistrict and Borough Local Plans \\nLocal Planning Authorities (LPAs) must prepare and maintain an up to date Local \\nPlan for their area covering a 15 year period. The LPAs in West Sussex are at \\ndifferent stages of Plan preparation. There are key stages that every authority \\nneeds to undertake when preparing a Local Plan. These include: \\n- Early consultation (Regulation 18) \\n- Pre-Submission Representation Period (Regulation 19) \\n- Submission \\n- Public Examination \\n- Proposed Modifications – if required by Inspector \\n- Adoption. \\nThe table overleaf sets out which stage in the Plan preparation process each of \\nthe LPAs reached at December 2023. \\nLocal plan review timetables are subject to review and if up to date information \\nis required should be checked on the District / Borough website. \\nThe County Council sets out the improvements required to enable the provision \\nof County Council services to meet the needs of new strategic development.  \\nThey reflect the County Council’s statutory responsibilities, including education '),\n",

The requirements for mitigation from the allocations in the \\nAdopted Local Plan for Arun District (SD1 – SD11) is if for  \\n• a new 10FE secondary school \\nAs the Local Education Authority (LEA) the County Council has the statutory duty \\nto make or secure education provision available for each child in its area, and to \\nprovide or secure the provision of a school place for each child, within the local \\ncatchment area (being as close to the place of residence as is reasonably \\npracticable) where possible. Schools should be provided close to where the need \\narises, to encourage sustainable travel behaviour and the wider benefits of being \\npart of a local community. An inability to meet school places nearby could result \\nin pupils being allocated spaces at a greater distance from their home, not in \\naccordance with sustainable place making or education provision policy.   \\nThe requirement for a new secondary school to serve Arun District was identified \\nas early as 2016 based on the number of strategic allocations identified at the \\nstart of the preparation works for the Local Plan that was adopted in 2018.  \\n \\nT\\nhere are currently six secondary schools in the District that broadly serve the \\nimmediate area where they are located (although it is recognised that pupils at \\nsecondary school age are prepared to travel a greater distance for education). \\nThe schools currently offer a cumulative total of 51FE. The proposed housing \\nallocations across the District will, by the end of the plan period, create a \\nrequirement for a further 14FE, however if the increase in BEW of a further 1300 \\ndwellings is approved this will increase the requirement by a further 1.5 - 2FE \\ndepending on the tenure of the housing.  \\nThe County Council considers that schools should be provided close to where the \\nneed arises, as this will encourage sustainable travel behaviour. The largest \\ndevelopment-related increase in the pupil population in Arun District is expected \\nto arise in the Barnham/Westergate school planning area, as this includes the \\nproposed strategic site allocations at BEW, Ford, Fontwell and Yapton. The \\nexisting schools in this area have limited capacity for expansion to meet this \\nneed. The Arun DC site assessment process has indicated that site options in the \\nFord area (outside of the proposed site allocation) should be considered and \\npolicies in the Arun Local Plan facilitate a new secondary school in this area. \\nThe intention to allocate the site was also clearly stated, along with the costs \\nidentified in a paper, prepared jointly between West Sussex County Council and '),\n",

The Borough is broken down into \\nfour school planning areas for primary, Northeast, Northwest, Southeast and \\nSouthwest and the schools are divided into these areas in line with their \\ngeographical location.  For secondary, Crawley is not broken down into a \\nquadrant, as all secondary schools are within the travel distance for children \\nwithin the Borough. \\nDemand for primary school places has plateaued in Crawley after a period of \\nrapid growth.  Significant new housing, immigration patterns (as the town is \\nclose to Gatwick airport), inward migration from London (where house prices are \\nhigher), and economic growth and full employment (due to the proximity of the \\ntown to the M23 corridor and Gatwick Diamond) played a part in the growth from \\n2012.  With the underlying birth rate falling, further exacerbated by COVID and \\nthe fall off in employment at the airport, there are now surplus primary school \\nplaces.  However, an unknown is the number of refugee families being moved to \\nthe town, sometimes at quite short notice, which could reduce the number of \\nsurplus places significantly. \\nSecondary school places are on a different trajectory, with the growth in demand \\nfor primary places from 2012 now impacting the secondary phase.  This has \\nimpacted the schools for the last four years, with a shortfall in total places \\nanticipated this year, and for a further seven years.   \\nCrawley Northeast – primary provision \\nForge Wood Primary opened in its new building in September 2017.  The school \\nserves a strategic development of up to 1900 homes of which half are now built \\nout.  The school offers 60 places per year of age but could expand further if \\nrequired. \\nThe table below provides historic information on the total number of available \\nprimary places in the reception year across all primary schools in the school \\nplanning area compared with the actual number of pupils starting school that \\nyear.

Recent rapid growth in demand in primary \\nschool places is now impacting on secondary schools. \\nHowever, in the East Grinstead planning area and some of the rural catchments \\nthe population of young children is decreasing, and schools are struggling for \\nnumbers.

The situation will be monitored annually and \\ndiscussed with schools in each locality. \\nSecondary provision:  There is an expected 200 secondary applications in excess \\nof planned admission numbers (PANs) currently available at the seven secondary \\nschools by 2027.  Parents/carers will therefore wish to consider including their \\ncatchment school in their 3 preferences as some children may need to travel for \\ntheir education until the new school, Bedelands Academy, opens to the north of \\nBurgess Hill in 2026 - 2027.  The existing schools have agreed to offer additional \\nplaces in 2024 and discussions are underway about how additional provision can \\nbe made in 2025 and 2026.  Based on historical trends there is usually a high \\ndrop off rate to the independent sector which helps ensure extra places are \\navailable.  Parents/carers are advised to refer to the County’s Home to School \\nTransport policy on eligibility for transport before making their preferences. \\n  '),\n",

It differs from a prosecution in that it recognises that, for \\nsome families a prolonged period of support and guidance is needed if problems are to be \\nresolved. \\nThe ESO is not an end product and imposing it on a family will not provide a solution to the \\nproblems of irregular attendance. The application process, the plans put into place and the \\nrelationship between the Pupil Entitlement Investigating Officer, the school and the family \\nare what matters. \\nWhen is an ESO considered? \\nAn ESO must be considered by the Local Authority before instituting criminal proceedings for \\noffences as defined by S.443 and S.444 of the Education Act 1996.    \\nIn addi\\ntion if criminal court action has been instigated the Magistrates of the Court having \\nconvicted a parent may direct the Local Authority to apply for an ESO unless the Authority \\ndecides that the child’s welfare will be satisfactorily safeguarded even though no ESO is \\nmade. \\nPupil Entitlement: Investigation recognise that some families are trying hard to ensure \\nregular school attendance but are facing multiple issues which make achieving that difficult. \\nIf parents and the child are willing to work with us to help address those issues and work \\ntowards improving attendance, then an ESO is a way that both parties can show they are \\nserious in obtaining that objective. An ESO can help in instances where parents struggle to \\nexercise proper control over their children’s lives.  \\nThe Grounds for making an ESO are that the child or young person is not being properly \\neducated (i.e. not receiving efficient full-time education suitable to his age, ability and \\naptitude and any SEN he may have) either through regular attendance at school or subject \\nto a School Attendance Order which has not being complied with.  \\nOutcome of an ESO being granted by the Court. \\nAn ESO requires the Local Authority to name a Supervising Officer who is officer who is \\nresponsible for advising, supporting and giving “directions” to the supervised child and their \\nparents in such a way as to ensure that the child is properly educated.  The directions should '),\n",

More \\ninformation on “directions” is offered below. \\nThe Supervisor is required to advise, assist and befriend and give directions to the child and \\nthe child’s parents in such a way as will, in the supervisor’s opinion, secure the child’s proper \\neducation. The Supervisor will provide the links between home and school and liaise with \\nother agencies where necessary.  \\nIt remains the parent’s responsibility to ensure their child goes to school regularly. \\nWhat are directions? \\nA\\n direction is an instruction made by the Supervising Officer to either the parent tor the child.  \\nThere are consequences and sanctions for failing to comply with them. \\nAll ESO’s automatically have a number of directions; \\n• The child must keep the supervisor informed of any change in his/her address; and \\n• The child must allow the supervisor to visit him/her at the place where he is living. \\n• The parent of the child must inform the supervisor of where the child is living, if asked \\n• If the parent lives with the child, they must allow the supervisor reasonable contact \\nwith the child. \\nBefore giving directions, the Supervising Officer will consider the wishes and feelings of both \\nthe parent and the child concerned.  This does not mean that the person receiving the \\ndirection has to agree to it however. \\nDirections can be made at any point during the life of the order, as many times as \\nappropriate for the Supervising Officer to deliver the plan and improve attendance.  \\nIf you think that a direction given to you is unreasonable then you should challenge the \\nSupervisor so that the direction can be discussed. Ultimately however, if the Supervisor \\nconsiders that the direction is reasonable then you or your child must comply with the \\ndirection. \\nWhat happens if the direction is not complied with? \\nIf a parent persistently fail without good reason to comply with a direction, then you may be \\nguilty of a criminal offence under Schedule 3, Part III, paragraph 18(1) Children Act 1989.  \\nThis could result in the parent going to a Magistrates Court as a criminal matter who can \\nimpose a fine of up to £1000 in addition to other costs. \\nIf a child fails without good reason to comply with the direction, then the family will be \\nreferred to Social Services who must investigate your families’ circumstances. \\nParents Right when an ESO is in place. \\nWhere an ESO is in force, parents lose their rights to; '),\n",

It recognises that family life is vital for developing children’s health and \\nwellbeing. \\n“Children are part of families, who are part of communities, who are part of society.  If we \\nwant a diverse, inclusive and welcoming society we first have to include children in settings, \\nwhich are part of communities. ” - Ann Van Dyke, 8 November 2023\\nServices supporting early years children and their families can make a difference when they work \\ntogether. West Sussex County Council (WSCC) is committed to working with our partners to ensure \\nthat services are fully coordinated and based on evidence. We want to provide seamless pathways for \\nchildren and families so that they have access to high quality universal services from conception to \\n5 years old, as well as additional support where required. We want to create a system-wide approach \\nto early years and childcare, health, and educational outcomes, supporting families from birth and \\nbeyond, overcoming deprivation and reducing inequalities, ensuring children are safe, happy, and \\nmake the best start in life.\\nWSCC knows that good, high quality, affordable childcare is an essential ingredient in economic, \\nsocial, educational outcome and recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Investment in the expansion \\nof funded entitlements for early years education and childcare is central to this strategy, along with \\nthe development of pathways to support the early years and childcare workforce. \\nVision \\n“From birth every child is nurtured, supported, and given the opportunity to develop well \\nand achieve their full potential in inclusive, safe, inspiring environments. The voice and \\nneeds of children and their families is sought and acted upon with holistic needs being \\nidentified early and effectively met, enabling children and families to be healthy and thrive. ” \\nThe strategy considers all children from conception to 5 years and their families in West Sussex \\nand children up t\\no 14 years who are accessing childcare provision (18 years if they have a Special \\nEducational Need and/or Disability [SEND]). \\nIt seeks to enable families in supporting their children’s health, well-being, learning and development \\nthrough early home learning and access to other services. It seeks to support all families including \\nthose returning to work. It will support providers and professionals with the quality and sustainability \\nof their provision and will help to build and strengthen communities. '),\n",

A sustainable and prosperous economy – there is a focus on workforce development and financial \\nsustainability of early years and childcare providers. The expansion of funded entitlements and \\nwraparound childcare sit within the strategy and will support families in returning to work.\\n3.

Two priorities are to:\\n1. Work with early years settings (amongst others) to close the disadvantage gap for children by \\ntargeting the most vulnerable.\\n2. Improve emotional health and wellbeing by providing early years settings with resources to \\nrespond confidently to children with these issues.\\nStakeholders in West Sussex take a Children First approach to ensure we work with children, young \\npeople, families, communities, our partners and schools in a restorative, strength-based way.

Crawley has the highest proportion of children living \\nin relative low-income families compared to other districts in the County, at 21.9% (around 5,500 \\nchildren), and exceeds the county (15.3%) and national (19.9%) average. \\nThe proportion of children aged 0-4 years attending Accident and Emergency and experiencing \\nhospital admissions caused by unintentional and deliberate injuries are significantly worse in West \\nSussex when compared to the National and Regional figures for 2022-2023. Measles, Mumps and \\nRubella uptake in West Sussex remains below the national target of 95%, whilst higher than the \\nEngland average, nearly one in five (19.8%) children aged 4-5 years old in reception year of primary \\nschool in West Sussex, have been measured as either overweight or obese. This is lower than the \\nnational average of 21.3% but the recent trend suggests no improvement.\\nSource: Public health profiles - OHID (phe.org.uk) | Source: Children in low income families: local area statistics - GOV.UK (gov.uk)\\nArea Count Value 95% Lower Centile 95% Upper Centile \\nCrawley 5,480 21.9 21.2 22.7\\nArun 4,808 19.0 18.3 19.7\\nAdur 1,898 16.4 15.4 17.3\\nWorthing 3,017 15.9 15.2 16.7\\nChichester 3,002 15.5 14.8 16.3\\nHorsham 2,830 10.8 10.3 11.4\\nMid Sussex 2,697 9.2 8.8 9.7\\nWest Sussex 23,732 15.3 15.0 15.5\\nEngland 2,087,494 19.9 19.9 20.0\\nChildren in relative low income families (under 16s) 2021/22\\n'),\n",

We encourage professionals to signpost \\nfamilies to this guidance. \\nSpecial schools in West Sussex are a key part of the services and provision for \\nchildren and young people with SEND and play an important role in supporting \\ndelivery of West Sussex SEND and Inclusion Strategy (2019–2024). \\nThe majority of children/young people with Special Educational Needs and \\nDisabilities (SEND) will be able to attend their local mainstream school where \\nthey will receive the support they need to do well.  The range and level/type of \\nneeds that can ordinarily be expected to be supported within a mainstream \\nsetting can be found in the Ordinarily Available Inclusive Practice Guide. \\nSome schools develop their own internal provision to support the additional \\nneeds of children and young people.  Schools include information on this type of \\nprovision in their SEND Information Report which can be found on their website. \\nSome children/young people will need an Education Health and Care Plan (EHCP) \\nto help make the provision they need and support them to achieve the outcomes \\nwe want them to achieve. \\nSometimes a child/young person will continue to struggle and not make \\nprogress, even with carefully planned and personalised support.  In these \\ncircumstances the best way of supporting them to achieve well may be through \\na placement at a more specialist provision.  In West Sussex we have both \\nSpecial Support Centres (attached to mainstream schools) and special schools to \\noffer this more specialist provision. \\nThis guidance is about our special schools, but we have also created similar \\nguidance for our Special Support Centres. \\nConsidering a Special School. \\nSometimes the EHC plan may show that a child or young person has such high, \\ncomplex or specialist needs that a special school might be a suitable option for \\nplacement.  Suitability for specialist provision does not mean all other types of \\nprovision are unsuitable.  The key to any placement for a pupil with an EHCP is \\nthat the setting can offer the prescribed provision and support to enable the \\npupil to meet their outcomes.  The consideration of suitable provision might \\ninclude what reasonable adjustments any type of setting can make to meet the \\npupil’s needs. '),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data-WordWizards/guidance_admissions_to_sp_schools.pdf', 'page': 1}, page_content='   \\n \\n \\n2 \\n \\nWhen considering the suitability of a West Sussex special school for a child or \\nyoung person with an EHCP the Local Authority will consider the principles set \\nout in this document alongside the detail of each particular setting set out in \\ntheir ‘Provision Descriptor’.  This consideration will also take into account the \\nindividual needs of the child/young person. \\nThis guidance and the provision descriptors are to support families and \\nprofessionals in understanding the process and provision available.  It does \\nnot, however, reflect specific criteria that must be met before \\nadmission. \\nA child/young person may be appropriately placed in a special school; but that \\ndoes not mean that other types of provision are not suitable.  Parents/carers are \\nstill able to choose a mainstream setting if they wish to. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n‘\\nIf a parent of a child, or young person, wants that child or young person to \\nattend a mainstream setting, the LA can only refuse if a mainstream placement \\nwould be incompatible with the efficient education of others, and there are no \\nreasonable steps the LA could take to avoid this’ (section 33 Children and \\nFamilies Act 2014). \\nMany children/young people with SEND will have a range of needs, and all \\nschools, including special schools, must make reasonable adjustments to meet \\nthe full range of needs of a child/young person in line with the Equality Act 2010. \\nWest Sussex Special schools \\nSpecial schools offer a range of provision for children/young people with the \\nmost significant needs who require a specialist and personalised curriculum and \\napproach to teaching and learning. \\nChildren/young people placed in special schools typically have: \\n• a range of needs that significantly impact on their learning and \\ndevelopment and/or their ability to access a mainstream curriculum and \\nenvironment  \\n• a combination of need that means that they require more specialist \\nsupport than that which can ordinarily be met in a mainstream school or \\nspecial support centre in a mainstream school. \\nChildren/young people who attend special schools require provision that is: \\n• in addition to or different from what might be expected through quality \\nfirst teaching and the range of differentiation and targeted intervention in \\na mainstream setting \\n• in addition to or different from that which would usually be provided in a \\nmainstream setting through provision made as set out in an EHCP \\n• in addition to and different from other children/young people of a similar \\nage.

In most cases it will, therefore, be important for the full \\nassessment to take place before consideration can be given to placing a child in \\na special school. \\nThere are 12 maintained/academy special schools in West Sussex catering for \\nchildren and young people with a range of needs. \\nIf you are thinking about a special school placement, you are strongly \\nencouraged to look at the provision descriptor for the setting (see links below) \\nand also the school websites.  Where possible it is advisable to arrange to visit \\nthe special school to see what they do. \\nThis guidance does not cover independent or non-maintained special schools. \\nThe Consideration and Admissions Process \\nThe WSCC Special Educational Needs Assessment Team (SENAT) are \\nresponsible for coordinating admissions into West Sussex special schools. \\nParent/carer’s or the young person themselves can make a request for a \\nparticular nursery, school or post-16 institution, and WSCC must comply \\nwith that preference and name the school or college in the EHC plan \\nunless: \\n• it would be unsuitable for the age, ability, aptitude or SEN of the child or \\nyoung person, or \\n• the attendance of the child or young person there would be incompatible \\nwith the efficient education of others, or the efficient use of resources, \\ne.g. needs could be able to be met in mainstream school  \\nThe Consultation \\nWhere a parent/carer or young person makes a preference for a West \\nSussex maintained special school or academy the West Sussex SEN \\nAssessment Team will always consult with that setting. \\nAlongside this consultation, SENAT will also consider the suitability of the \\npreferred setting and, as a result, they may consult with other settings \\nthey consider may be appropriate. \\n '),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data-WordWizards/guidance_admissions_to_sp_schools.pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content='   \\n \\n \\n4 \\n \\nSENAT will send the draft or Final EHCP and associated documents to the \\ngoverning body, principal or proprietor of the school or college. If the \\nschool/setting is in another local authority area, that Local Authority must be \\nconsulted too. \\n \\n \\n \\nT\\nhe school/setting has 15 days to respond, and their views will be considered \\ncarefully before deciding whether to name it in the child or young person’s EHC \\nplan. The setting must consider the child/young person’s needs and required \\nprovision in their response to the consultation. They must take into account the \\nSEND Code of Practice when providing their response. \\nThis may include schools considering: \\n• Whether they can meet the child/young person’s needs and make \\nsuitable provision as described in the EHCP.  This should include \\nconsidering what reasonable adjustments could be made to meet \\ntheir needs \\n• Whether they can offer a meaningful peer group of children/young \\npeople of a similar age, and with similar developmental, verbal, \\nsocial and academic levels \\n• Whether they can physically accommodate the child/young person in \\nthe school, having considered reasonable adjustments to create \\nappropriate space. \\nSENAT will consider all responses received and make the final decision  on \\nplacement.  As this process may be different depending on the current situation \\nfor the child/young person the SEN Assessment Team will keep individual families \\ninformed regarding progress. \\nDuring times of consideration of a large number of preferences for a particular \\nsetting SENAT and the setting may arrange specific consideration processes, i.e., \\na Consideration Meeting, to look at the full range of  pupil’s potentially seeking a \\nplacement.  This ensures a fair consideration process based on need during these \\nbusier times, for example when considering admissions into Year 7.  Again, the \\nSEN Assessment Team will keep families informed. \\nAlthough the majority of admissions take place at the beginning of an academic \\nyear, admissions into special schools can take place across the school year.

West Sussex County Council (WSCC) is \\nactively encouraging schools to consider the need in their community to \\nprovide early years and childcare services as appropriate.\\nTo support you and your school we have developed this guidance which should be  \\nused in conjunction with our Developing Childcare Provision Toolkit, which is available  \\non www.westsussex.gov.uk/childcaresufficiency. The tool kit is full of useful resources  \\nand templates to support your journey to opening high quality, sustainable childcare.\\nAlthough this is a st\\nep by step guide, you may find that some steps take place  \\nconcurrently, although it is strongly advised that steps 1–3 are carried out first.\\nDev\\neloping high quality, sustainable childcare provision is not a quick process and  \\nyour plans should take this into consideration in order to ensure you create a high quality \\nsetting within your c\\nommunity. This process can take anywhere between 6–12 months, \\npossibly longer if your project includes building alterations.\\nThe process must be owned and lead by those responsible for the governance of the  \\nschool. For example, the Governing Body, the Academy Trust or diocese. For the purpose  \\nof this document, we will refer to this as the Governing Body.\\n'),\n",

The Schools Governing Body \\nThis should be, at this stage, approval in principle and included \\nin formal minutes by the full Governing Body. The Governing \\nBody must be kept informed at all stages of the project. You \\nmay like to discuss the aims and objectives of doing this and \\nhow this will fit with the school’s ethos and wider plans. \\nSTEP 1   |  What do you want to do?\\n* Schools who are not controlled and run by the local authority, for example, Academies, Voluntary Aided,  \\nFree Schools, Foundation and Trust schools, will need to ensure they comply with their own governance.\\n2. West Sussex County Council (WSCC) Property Services \\nFirst and foremost, any school accommodation must be used for  \\nmeeting the basic demands of the school. WSCC therefore would  \\nreserve the right to ‘reclaim’ space if required for educational purposes. \\nWith that in mind, any school wishing to introduce childcare  \\nprovision will need to ensure the following has been undertaken  \\nin assessing the proposal:\\n1. Identify the spac\\ne to be used, period of use and the impact \\non school space and the ability to deliver curriculum. \\n2. Det\\nermine if the proposal is a commercial undertaking (this \\nis discussed in more detail later in step 4 of this guide).\\n3. Det\\nermine procedures for terminating the arrangement if necessary.\\n4. Det\\nermine if self-help must be submitted, should there be \\na change of use for the identified premises. Please contact \\nyour WSCC area surveyor for support and guidance.\\nPlease email ci.capitalprojects@westsussex.gov.uk for further \\nadvice on any of the above points and for approval to proceed.\\nThese steps must take place prior to assessing the viability \\nin detail.

The maximum hours can be taken over no \\nfewer than 38 weeks of the year (up to and including 15 hours per week). \\nParents may be able to take up patterns of hours which “stretch”  \\ntheir child’s entitlement by taking fewer free hours a week but over  \\nmore weeks of the year, where there is capacity and sufficient demand \\nfrom parents.

This information may offer us reason to believe that an offence has been committed contrary to s444 \\nEducation Act 1996; failure to secure the regular attendance at school.  The law defines regular attendance at school as \\nbeing as prescribed by the school.  This means that any unauthorised day of absence is tantamount to irregular \\nattendance.  Previous good attendance at school by your child has no bearing on the offence.  When evidence of the \\noffence is presented to our offices, we hold the statutory responsibility to address this, and can be achieved by way of \\noffering a FPN and/or bringing the matter before the Magistrates Court.   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nWhat is unauthorised absence from school? \\nUnauthorised absence occurs when the school have not given permission for the absence.  In school registers the codes \\nused are: \\n• ‘G’ Unauthorised Holiday in term time \\n• ‘U’ arriving at school after the register had closed. \\n• ‘O’ Other Unauthorised absence \\n• ‘N’ when the reason for an absence from school has not yet been identified – if not reason is offered by the \\nparent, it will likely be marked as ‘O’.   \\nIrrespective of which code above is used to mark the absence, they all amount to the same thing in law, namely they are \\nan unauthorised absence from school which amounts to an offence under the Education Act 1996.  It is the school who \\ndecide how to record your child’s absence and it is the school who decide whether to refer your absence to WSCC for \\nconsideration of the issuing of a FPN.  If you have information which was unknown to the school prior to the absence, \\nthen you should raise this with the FPN team in the first instance.  The FPN team will decide whether it should be \\nreferred to the school or not.  Please note there is no requirement for a school to consider information offered after the \\nfact.  If having referred back to the school, the school maintains the absence was unauthorised, the FPN will stand. FPNs \\ncannot be placed on hold whilst any such discussions are being undertaken.  \\nWhy do some schools authorise absence and another doesn’t?   \\nThe only individual who can authorise absence from school is the Head Teacher. They have the final decision on how \\nattendance is recorded. The law states that a Head Teacher may only authorise absences if they consider the \\ncircumstances of those absences to be “exceptional” which is a subjective term and can lead to different Head Teachers \\nwithin the same geographical area responding differently.   \\nGuidance relating to the term ‘exceptional’ has expressed that it means the ‘event is rare, unavoidable and short’ and \\nby ‘unavoidable’ it could not reasonably be scheduled at any other time.  Holiday’s taken during a term time are unlikely \\nto be authorised as generally speaking these are not exceptional as they can be scheduled at another time during a \\nschool holiday period.  In addition, the Government has clearly set out expectations to Head Teachers to not permit \\nabsence during term time and to use tools such as FPNs to address absences where appropriate.   \\nWho can be issued with a Fixed Penalty Notice (FPN)? \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFPN\\ns are issued to any adult considered to be a parent as defined by the Education Act 1996, which includes:  \\n• All natural (biological) parents, whether they are married or not. \\n• Any person who although not a natural parent has parental responsibility for a child or young person. \\n• Any person although not a natural parent has care of a child or young person.  Having care of a child or young \\nperson means that a person with whom the child lives and how looks after the child, irrespective of what their \\nrelationship is with the child.   \\nCan I appeal a Fixed Penalty Notice (FPN) and or give additional reasons/mitigation for the absence? \\nThere is no statutory right of appeal to a FPN.  However, we are willing to consider representations from parents and \\nyou can email us at FPN.PEI@westsussex.gov.uk'),\n",

If you consider your circumstances to be \\nexceptional and you had not shared all the information at the time of the request, you may wish to share new \\ninformation with the FPN team for consideration.  Please do so by emailing the FPN team.   \\n \\n \\nThe scheme does not allow for mitigation to be presented.  A FPN is actually a \"conditional offer\" for the offence of non-\\nschool attendance.   In all cases the proposal is a £160 fine.  In some cases, you may be offered the opportunity to pay \\nat the £80 rate if it is paid within 21 days for the first occasion a child is referred.  There is no flexibility, and this means \\nmitigation is not relevant. You can either take up the offer of the FPN by way of paying it or choose not to pay which \\nwould result in our legal services team serving papers on you for court action for the offence of failing to secure the \\nregular attendance at school of your child (S.444 Education Act 1996).   \\nThrough the Court process your mitigation and other reasons for the absence can be presented, either in person or in \\nwriting.  Please be aware, the court process can often result in higher punishment in terms of a fine and may also \\nrequire you to pay court costs if you are found guilty.   \\nMy child has good attendance at school. \\nThere is no attendance figure stipulated in law which defines regular attendance.  The supreme court defined regular \\nattendance as being attendance as prescribed by the school, and this means any absence without authority is \\ntantamount to irregular attendance.  Past and future attendance at school has no bearing on the matter.   \\nI have never caused my child to have unauthorised absence previously why should I have the same penalty as \\nsomebody who has done this more than once? \\nThe offer is as it says, a \"fixed penalty\" and the punishment is fixed for the offence, not for the parent and therefore \\ndoes not reflect on parenting ability.  If you believe that the punishment is too severe, you have the option to argue \\nyour case at Court, but you are unlikely to obtain any benefit by way of a reduced penalty.   \\nWhat time limit is there on a FPN, how do I pay, and can I pay by instalments? \\nThere are 28 days to pay the offered FPN.  The time frame of the payment and the amount payable are stated in law \\nand cannot be amended on a case by case basis.   FPNs cannot be placed on ‘hold’ and instalment plans are not \\npossible.  The amount of how much to pay and by when is outlined in the FPN itself.  Payment can be made by the \\nfollowing methods: \\n \\n \\n \\nOnline at: https://www.westsussex.gov.uk/ip - Click on the Miscellaneous option and select Fixed Penalty Notice – \\nSchool Attendance Fine. \\nTelephone:  01243 777505 between 09:00 to 17:00 Monday to Friday \\nIf you cannot afford the payment or can only afford to pay by instalments the only place where a payment plan can be \\nagreed is at Court.  The Court can and do consider individual financial circumstances.   \\nWhat happens if I don’t pay the FPN? \\nShould you choose not to pay the FPN then this will likely lead to the underlying non-attendance offence being referred \\nto the Magistrates Court.  The court process will offer you an opportunity to outline the reasons why you dispute the \\nmatter. The defences to the charge are limited and you may wish to consider taking legal advice before choosing not to \\npay the FPN. Please note that should the court find you guilty of the non-school attendance offence they can impose a \\nhigher punishment than the level of the FPN. The court may also order you to pay court costs.  \\nShould you remain dissatisfied with the handling of the FPNs process you may follow the County Council’s complaints \\nprocedure which can be found on the Internet at:  \\n \\nhttp://www.westsussex.gov.uk/your_council/get_in_touch/comments_compliments_and/make_a_comment_complim\\nent/comment_compliment_or_complai.aspx \\n '),\n",

We understand that some students are not able to use \\npublic transport, and some may need independent travel training to enable them \\nto start using buses or trains. In some cases, parents will be able to give training \\nand in others, schools and colleges will provide it. A taxi/minibus will not be \\nprovided where a young person is assessed as being able to undertake \\nindependent travel training and the parent refuses permission for the young \\nperson to take part. \\n \\nWhere a student of sixth form age meets eligibility criteria 1 to 4, parents \\nwill need to pay a contribution of £826 per year towards the cost of the \\ntransport assistance. This can be paid in instalments. The cost is from \\nSeptember 2024 and subject to annual review. \\nNo contribution is paid if you have a low family income as defined in 5 \\nbelow. \\nNo contribution is paid for those who take up a fuel allowance of 30p per \\nmile. \\n \\n \\nYou may be eligible for a Disabled Person’s Bus Pass, which gives you free \\ntravel on bus services.

They will \\nbe able to choose from: \\n• full-time education (e.g., at a school or college) \\n• full-time education (e.g., at a school or college) \\n• an apprenticeship or traineeship \\n• part-time education or training combined with one of the following: \\n - employment or self-employment for 20 hours or more a week \\n - volunteering for 20 hours or more a week.  \\nHelp with transport is not offered t o young people in part-time training or         \\neducation, or to those on apprenticeships, including Programme Led \\nApprenticeships. Transport assistance to the work element of Supported \\nInternships may be funded through the Access to Work Scheme, available \\nthrough colleges. \\nGeneral information \\n•  Travel assistance is not normally provided for retakes or repeat periods \\nof study. \\n•  If your family income seems too high for you to qualify for free transport \\nat the beginning of the year but your family circumstances change, e.g. \\nbecause of redundancy, illness or divorce, please email the address at \\nthe end of these notes with full details of the situation. Further \\nconsideration will then be given to your case. \\n•  Transport is not provided for taster sessions or induction weeks \\n•  You may have already started travelling to school or college. If you wish \\nto be reimbursed for the costs incurred, you must keep safe any receipts \\nfor tickets already bought. Reimbursement will normally be backdated \\nonly to the beginning of the term in which the application was received. \\nTravel expenses are reimbursed on the basis of the most economical \\nrate, which may not cover your costs fully. \\n•  If you are not entitled to support or you arrange your own transport, you \\nwill wish to travel by the most economical route, using all available \\ndiscounts and season tickets.

A fresh application must be made each school/college \\nyear. \\n• Young adult Learners shou ld contact their social worker in the first \\ninstance.  Those without a social worker should contact the Adult Services \\nCare Point on 01243 642121 or email socialcare@westsussex.gov.uk \\nIf you are eligible for support you will be sent a letter explaining how your \\nsupport will be provided and whether you or your parents will be asked to pay \\nthe contribution. The contribution will be made if you do not meet the financial \\ncriteria (in para 5) or accept the 30p per mile fuel payment.  Payments can be \\nmade monthly, in two termly instalments or in full.  \\nThe fuel payment rate is 25p per mile (currently with a 5p cost of fuel \\nenhancement making a rate of 30p per mile.)  In exceptional cases where a child \\nis judged by the council to otherwise need to travel alone due to severe and \\ncomplex needs an enhanced rate of 40p per mile (currently enhanced to 45p per \\nmile) may be paid. These rates are revised from time to time. \\nThe parental contribution goes towards the costs. It is not reduced because a \\nstudent travels only three days each week, or starts a course late, for example. \\nIf you are not happy with the decision about your eligibility for \\nhelp with transport \\nIssues or requests for a decision review should be addressed in the first instance \\nto the Pupil and Student Support Office. Most queries are resolved at this stage. \\nIf however you are not satisfied with a decision about eligibility for assistance, \\nthere is a formal appeal process.  A Stage One appeal may be made to the \\nDirector of Education and Skills.  There is specific appeal paperwork that you will \\nneed to fill out which can be sent to you by request.  This is in addition to the \\nCounty Council’s corporate complaints procedure. \\nEvery effort will be made to resolve any issues but in some cases it may be \\nnecessary to refer the matter to a panel of elected members (Stage Two).

These other \\ndocuments set out the process of consultation and other elements of the Code of \\nPractice that are relevant to this guidance. \\nIntroduction \\nThis guidance aims to help families, schools, early years settings, colleges, voluntary \\nsector organisations that support families and other professionals understand the \\nprocess and considerations that must take place when a preference for an \\nindependent or non-maintained school is received or when the Local Authority \\nthemselves is considering making a place in an independent or non-maintained \\nschool. \\nWe encourage professionals to signpost families to this guidance. \\nWhat are independent and non-maintained schools? \\nIndependent schools are usually privately run for profit (also described as private \\nschools). \\nNon-maintained schools are usually managed by charitable organisations and are not \\nprofit-making. \\nNeither are maintained/overseen by local authorities. \\nMost children with an education health and care plan will be able to go to a local \\nmainstream school or special school maintained by the local authority. \\nLocal school placements will always be investigated as a matter of course, prior to \\nthe consideration of an independent, or non-maintained school. \\nHowever, the following sections of the special education needs (SEN) Code of \\nPractice are important to share in this guidance: \\nSection 9.78 - The child’s parent or the young person has the right to request a \\nparticular school, college or other institution of the following type to be named in \\ntheir EHC plan: \\n• Maintained nursery school. \\n• Maintained school and any form of academy or free school (mainstream or \\nspecial). \\n• Non-maintained special school. \\n• Further education or sixth form college. \\n• Independent school or independent specialist colleges, where they have been \\napproved for this purpose by the Secretary of State and published in a list \\navailable to all parents and young people. This is called the Section 41 list and can \\nbe found on the GOV.UK website. '),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data-WordWizards/guidance_admissions_to_inmss.pdf', 'page': 1}, page_content='Section 9.79 - If a child’s parent or a young person makes a request for a particular \\nnursery, school or post-16 institution in these groups the local authority must comply \\nwith that preference and name the school or college in the EHC plan unless: \\n• it would be unsuitable for the age, ability, aptitude or SEN of the child or young \\nperson, or \\n• the attendance of the child or young person there would be incompatible with \\nthe efficient education of others, or the efficient use of resources. \\nSection 9.80 - The local authority must consult the governing body, principal or \\nproprietor of the school or college concerned and consider their comments very \\ncarefully before deciding whether to name it in the child or young person’s EHC plan, \\nsending the school or college a copy of the draft plan. If another local authority \\nmaintains the school, they too must be consulted. \\nSection 0.84 - The child’s parent or the young person may also make representations \\nfor places in non-maintained early years provision or at independent schools or \\nindependent specialist colleges or other post-16 providers that are not on the list \\nmentioned at 9.78 above and the local authority must consider their request. The \\nlocal authority is not under the same conditional duty to name the provider but must \\nhave regard to the general principle in section 9 of the Education Act 1996 that \\nchildren should be educated in accordance with their parents’ wishes, so long as this \\nis compatible with the provision of efficient instruction and training and does not \\nmean unreasonable public expenditure. The local authority should be satisfied that \\nthe institution would admit the child or young person before naming it in a plan since \\nthese providers are not subject to the duty to admit a child or young person even if \\nnamed in their plan. \\nWhat does this mean in West Sussex? \\nLocally maintained school placements will always be investigated as a matter of \\ncourse, prior to the consideration of an independent, or non- maintained school. \\nThis is because independent and non-maintained schools are fee-charging \\norganisations and therefore the Local Authority is duty bound to consider the most \\nefficient use of their resources (public money) in all their decision-making. \\nAs maintained schools are already funded in part, and are often geographically \\nnearer, they are usually less costly than non-maintained or independent schools. \\nIf a parent/carer or young person expresses a preference for a non-maintained \\nsetting or an independent setting approved by the Secretary of State (often called \\nSection 41 providers) the SEN Assessment Team will consult with that preference \\nalongside the work they do to consider other maintained options. \\nIf a parent/carer or young person expresses a preference for an independent school \\nnot approved by the Secretary of State, the SEN Assessment Team are not required \\nto consult with them. They may decide to engage with them to learn about their offer \\nand their ability to meet the child/young person’s needs; but they are not required \\nto. '),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data-WordWizards/guidance_admissions_to_inmss.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content='Dynamic Placement System (DPS) \\nWest Sussex County Council has established a dynamic placement system (DPS) that \\nsupports finding suitable placements for children with disabilities and special \\neducational needs when a placement is required in an independent or non- \\nmaintained special school. Some of these schools will be physically outside of West \\nSussex. \\nIndependent and non-maintained schools are invited to be part of this system which \\nallows West Sussex to co-ordinate admissions and ensure appropriate contractual \\nand other monitoring mechanisms are in place for these settings. \\nIf the SEN Assessment Team considers that a non-maintained or independent school \\nmight be required, they will do a referral to the DPS. This involves sending \\nanonymised information about the child or young person’s needs to all the approved \\nproviders on the system. \\nProviders are asked to express an interest in meeting the child/young person’s \\nneeds. Ideally, they will do this within 5 working days of the initial referral. \\nSENAT will then consider the responses and most likely refer the expressions of \\ninterest and all other work that has taken place to consider local placements to the \\nSEN Panel for discussion. \\nIf placement in an independent or non-maintained placement is agreed in principle \\nby the SEN Panel a formal consultation will also take place (if it has not already) \\nbefore the placement can be agreed/named in an EHCP. \\nKey Points \\nMost requests for independent or non-maintained schools will need to be discussed \\nand agreed at SEN Panel. \\nDiscussion at SEN Panel will require clear information associated with any \\nlocal/maintained options, the costs of all the options and any other relevant \\ninformation about the offer being made by any potential setting. \\nConsideration at SEN Panel will firstly focus on ability to meet the child/young \\nperson’s needs (as set out in the EHCP) and then the cost. \\nThe response from possible settings informs this consideration, alongside any further \\nwork undertaken by team members in SENAT. \\nThe Planning Co-Ordinator in SENAT will most likely be the parent/carer or young \\nperson’s key contact, so they will keep them updated regarding this process. \\nFurther information about the DPS can be found on the West Sussex Local Offer \\nwebsite.

Many of the key \\npriorities already established to \\nimprove outcomes and provision for \\nall children in West Sussex remain \\nour key priorities.

The strategy has children, young people and adults with special \\neducational needs and disabilities (SEND) in West Sussex at \\nthe centre of its thinking. We spoke to parents and carers, \\nyoung people, those working in or supporting an education \\nsetting,  members of the council, and its officers to develop \\nthe strategy. The SEND & Inclusion Strategy 2019–2024 is \\na central plank to improve provision and outcomes for our \\nchildren and young people with additional learning needs. \\n2.  The strategy is integral to our Council Plan 2021–2025 and  \\nits key priorities:\\n•  keeping people safe from vulnerable situations;\\n•  promoting a sustainable and prosperous economy; \\n•  helping people and communities fulfil their potential; and\\n•  making the best use of resources.\\n3.  Our seven education and learning 2023–25 key themes \\nhave a direct link to our Council Plan 2021–2025 to \\nbroaden the skills, ambitions and opportunities for all \\nchildren, young people and our most vulnerable adults. It \\nsupports them in the foundations to contribute to future \\neconomic growth and prosperity in West Sussex. \\n4.   The Education and Learning Strategy embodies statutory \\nresponsibilities but does not outline all the functions of a local \\nauthority. Many operational statutory responsibilities run \\nalongside the strategy in the form of continued business as usual. \\n5.  We will work collaboratively with all stakeholders over the next \\nthree years to ensure that all West Sussex children and young \\npeople have access to high quality education and learning. \\nWe aim to help everyone to achieve the best outcomes and \\nopportunities for future education, employment, or training. \\nThe council’s ambitions in tackling climate change remain \\ncentral to the actions taken to implement this strategy. \\n6.  West Sussex County Council’s Department for Children, Young \\nPeople and Learning is committed to putting ‘Children First’ in its \\nwork and strategic thinking. The department has been through \\na major redesign in the way it delivers services to support \\nchildren, young people and families. For the Education and Skills \\nDirectorate, this has led to greater co-ordination of resources \\nalongside Children’s Social Care and Early Help. This restructure \\nhas enabled a single view of the child’s learning journey from \\nthe age of two  through our early years’ settings, schools, post 16 '),\n",

This provides an opportunity for \\nthe strategy to tackle some of the challenges that are complex \\nand difficult to address, particularly at key transition points in \\nthat journey. It allows us to deliver a cohesive programme to \\nmake a difference as we challenge the barriers to success.\\n7.   The seven key themes are supported with more detailed \\nworkstream plans and timelines co-created with partners and \\nstakeholders. Workstreams will be developed and fine-tuned as  \\nthe strategy unfolds and initiatives are introduced. Whilst the \\nEducation and Learning Strategy incorporates planning for Post 16 \\nand Adult Community Education, it will not cover the wider skills \\nagenda in full. A council-wide Skills Strategy will be developed \\nseparately with its own governance, reflecting the multiple \\nstakeholders across Sussex. The Skills Strategy will align to sector \\nled strategic planning and ensure a skilled workforce able to meet \\nfuture economic needs and developments in the region. \\n8.   The Education and Learning Strategy is not a catch all. It cannot \\ncover all the challenges facing children and families as we emerge \\nfrom the COVID- 19 pandemic and face the significant cost of living \\ncrisis. It is a strategy focused on learning and achievement within \\nthe boundaries of the levers for change that a local authority can \\napply. The strategy will need to be viewed alongside the detail \\nof the SEND & Inclusion Strategy 2019–24, the broader council \\nstrategies for Mental Health and Wellbeing, and the key plans \\nwithin the Children, Young People and Learning Department. It \\nmust also be viewed alongside major national policies on the \\nfuture role of a local authority in education and learning, and \\nthe priorities set within these policies for improving outcomes \\nfor children and young people aged between two and 19.  \\n9. Several principles that underpin our strategic intent, \\nand which provide influence and support to enable \\nchange to happen, are outlined in paragraph 26. '),\n",

During 2021–22, the Education and Skills Directorate went through \\na significant redesign. This led to a rethink in how we operate \\nto support schools and learning providers in line with the local \\nauthority’s statutory responsibilities. This led to incorporating Early \\nYears Education and Care, the management of Free Entitlement \\nfor two and three-year-olds, and support for Private, Voluntary \\nand Independent (PVI) Early Years providers. This provides an \\nopportunity to address the quality and continuity of provision \\nfrom early years into schools. This connection has reframed our \\nalignment to the council’s Early Help and Family Safeguarding \\nservices in a district and borough structure to better join up \\nthe support for our most vulnerable children and families. \\n11.  Since 2022, there have been significant reductions in government \\nfunding to fulfil the council’s school improvement responsibilities \\nfor provision and outcomes. This has provided an opportunity \\nto reassess how such services can be reconfigured to meet \\nfuture priorities. It has led to greater targeting of resources to \\nwork with schools and providers needing the greatest help. \\nIt also has led to more external commissioning of expertise \\nfrom schools and partners to provide peer support to schools, \\nand to create a broader traded offer of services.

Increased costs and inflationary \\npressures combined with a falling birth rate leaves some \\nschools and Early Years settings facing a challenging future. \\n12. The role of the local authority is changing in response to national \\npolicy and changes in funding which will determine the way we \\noperate in the future. Three key national policy initiatives have \\nbeen introduced in 2022, each of which have a direct impact \\non the strategic and operational role of a local authority. These \\ninclude the Education White Paper: ‘Opportunities for All’ (2022); \\nthe SEND and Alternative Provision Plan ‘Right Support; Right \\nPlace; Right Time;’ 2022; and changes in Post 16 Qualifications. \\nWhilst the Schools Bill (2022) aiming to embed ‘Opportunities for \\nAll’ into law has been withdrawn, some key expectations remain. \\n13. The national deficit in the government funding to support \\nspecial educational needs, and our work to reduce local \\nfinancial pressures will continue to be a significant priority \\nfor the Education and Skills Directorate. This will be reflected \\nin the way services are deployed and reshaped to support \\neducation and learning into the future. It may reduce flexibilities \\nto support beyond the local authority’s statutory role. '),\n",

Stakeholder engagement took place between February and \\nJune 2022 to gather a range of views on the future direction \\nof education and learning within the county. An online survey \\ndrew significant interest from parents and the community. \\nFocused engagement sessions with schools and the further \\neducation sector gave a greater understanding of current and \\nfuture priorities. Additional engagement sessions with officers \\nand councillors reflected organisational priorities in response \\nto the publication of national policy initiatives in April 2022. \\n15.  There are 10 key challenges which were raised as part of  \\nthe engagement events.\\n•  Whilst academic success and educational outcomes have \\nimproved in recent years, there is still more to do to ensure \\nthat all children achieve as well as they ought. Some families \\nface challenges which put them at a disadvantage. The \\nimpact of COVID-19 has interrupted learning and impacted \\nthe confidence of many children and young people.\\n•  Assessment and examination results in 2022 reflect the \\nsignificant disruption to learning over the last two years.\\n•  Children who have SEND or are vulnerable, for example young \\ncarers, are not always achieving as well as they might, and \\ninclusive practice is not consistently applied in all schools \\nor across all parts of the county to enable them to do so.\\n•  There are still too many children falling out of education \\nand learning either through exclusions or as parents \\nremove children from school rolls when they hold the \\nopinion that provision is not meeting their child’s needs.\\n•  Learning and curriculum opportunities, along with the \\nquality of provision for children and young people varies \\nacross the county. This results in ‘inequality of access’ to \\nthe range of opportunities appropriate to both children \\nand young people’s needs and interests and is too \\ndependent on where children live within the county.\\n•  Even before children reach school age, the underachievement \\nof our disadvantaged children is notable compared with their \\nnon-disadvantaged peers. Whilst progress is being made to \\nclose the disadvantaged gap, as seen in the 2022 Key Stage 2 \\nassessments, the overall discrepancy seen in disadvantaged \\nchildren’s readiness for school at the end of the early years \\nremains a constant throughout their learning journey.'),\n",

There can be limited opportunities \\nfor the full range of options in some areas leading to students \\nhaving either to travel to find the courses they want to study \\nor pursue local courses to which they may not be suited\\n•  Some of our most vulnerable young people continue to \\nbe at risk of criminal exploitation, exclusion, or harm.\\n•  The current number of specialist placements in our \\nmaintained schools and academies is currently insufficient \\nto meet escalating demand. This is leading to children \\nincreasingly having to travel out of their local communities \\nor attend private schools at significant cost.\\n•  The proportion of surplus places in our primary schools is \\nincreasing as the birth rate falls and house building slows \\ndown. This places pressure on schools both in retaining \\nstaff, and also in managing the needs of all children \\nwith dwindling resources. It also leads to some schools \\nbecoming vulnerable, affecting their ability to continue their \\nimprovement journey and maintain financial stability.\\n16.   The online survey and engagement sessions identified the \\ntop priorities for learning provision over the next three years. \\nFeedback from those involved has been central to identifying the \\nkey themes and to developing a common vision and strategy. \\n'),\n",

To keep children safe from vulnerable situations and help people \\nand communities fulfil their potential, West Sussex County \\nCouncil aims to address issues of inequality in education and \\nlearning. It aims to level up the quality of provision in those \\nlocalities and in those learning providers where provision is not \\nmeeting the needs and interests of all. This includes provision \\nfor the most vulnerable, those with SEND, and those who \\nhave ambitions for vocational qualifications. It also includes \\nproviders and schools requiring improvement, along with those \\ndistricts and boroughs where pupil and student outcomes are \\nnot high enough. All children and young people deserve the \\nbest start in life in West Sussex and this can only be achieved if \\nthey have full access to a broad range of high-quality learning \\nopportunities. This will enable every young person to secure \\nthe skills, knowledge, and confidence they need to help them \\nachieve their own ambitions. It will help support the development \\nof a sustainable and prosperous economy across West Sussex.\\n18.   Overcoming inequalities, learning gaps, and providing \\nadditional support is the responsibility of everyone involved \\nwith the lives of children. This can only be achieved through \\nco-operation and  strong, responsive partnership working \\nacross all services, families and learning providers.\\n19. The Education and Learning Strategy 2023–2025 is part \\nof a co-ordinated series of actions and plans within the \\nChildren, Young People and Learning department. To \\ntackle the barriers that many families face, our broad set of \\nrelationships need to be coordinated. Working collectively \\nwill enable children, young people and vulnerable adults to \\nbecome independent and secure their best outcomes.  \\n20.  Inclusion and respecting the needs and vulnerabilities of all is \\ncentral to our mission. Through a culture of value and respect, \\nWest Sussex County Council puts the principle of ‘Children First’ \\nin all our decisions. This embeds a focus on high achievement \\nand good progress made by all children from their respective \\nstarting points. Where there is discrimination, or where children \\nand young people are restricted from achieving success, it is \\nthe local authority’s role to challenge and create a climate that \\nvalues children and young people and helps them succeed.

The Education and Skills Annual Report in 2020 identified \\na number of key priorities based on the council’s \\neducation and learning performance measures at the \\ntime. These included but were not restricted to:\\n•  ensuring all pupils who are disadvantaged and those who are \\nmore able are challenged to achieve their potential;    \\n•  providing strategic support for curriculum design, \\nimplementation and impact;\\n•  implementing the SEND & Inclusion Strategy 2019–24;\\n•  exploring and implementing creative approaches to alternative \\nprovision to reduce the risk of exclusion; and\\n•  integrating cross directorate service delivery through the \\nChildren First Strategy.\\n22.  West Sussex County Council and schools have worked hard \\nto tackle these priorities, but the impact of COVID-19 cannot \\nbe underestimated.

However, several of the 2020 priorities remain \\ntoday. National research and reporting have shown that many \\nchildren and young people have lost ground over the period of \\nthe pandemic. Some have suffered a loss of confidence, increased \\nanxiety, and have found their return to school challenging.\\n23.  National GCSE and A level results in 2022 show a mixed picture \\nfor pupil and student attainment. This has been reflected in \\nWest Sussex and, although there was an improvement from \\n2019, results were lower than the high achievements in 2020 \\nand 2021 and varied between schools. Ensuring that schools \\nhave the knowledge, expertise and resources to support social, \\nemotional and mental health to help pupils catch up is essential. \\n24.   ‘Learning to live with COVID-19’ and new ways of working in \\nschools, coincided with the Government introducing several \\nkey policy initiatives during 2022, some of which will play a \\nmajor role in the future shape of provision, the drive to raise \\nstandards in schools, and also the role of local authorities \\nand their responsibilities for education. This will affect the \\nway funding is deployed, as well as  the way local authorities \\nand their partners influence provision and outcomes. \\n'),\n",

Achieving better outcomes relies on our key relationships  \\n \\n \\nwith private providers in the early years sector, schools and \\ntheir governing bodies; the academy sector and further \\neducation providers. \\n26.   This strategy requires co-operation and an openness among \\nlearning providers to align their own priorities with those \\nidentified by West Sussex County Council. It also relies \\non the key principles being shared by all stakeholders \\nto maximise impact. The principles are as follows.\\n•  Improving learning is more than improving outcomes for \\nchildren; improving learning involves developing a lifelong \\npassion and curiosity for learning through into adulthood.\\n•  Improving learning and achievement is focused on all children \\nand young people achieving as well as they can.\\n•  Centres of learning, which could be schools, early years providers, \\nor independent alternative curriculum providers, should always \\nprovide children and young people with a safe environment \\nwhere they can learn confidently and are free from intimidation, \\nprejudice, and harassment\\n•  The West Sussex County Council SEND & Inclusion Strategy, \\nagreed in 2019, should remain at the heart of the Education \\nand Learning Strategy with inclusive practice at  the core of  the \\nculture of all centres of learning.\\n•  Improving provision and outcomes for children with SEND and \\nvulnerabilities is only possible through strong partnerships and \\ncollective ownership of actions and policy from across the sector.\\n•  The local authority will, within its statutory powers and \\nresponsibilities, provide strategic direction and ambition to \\nachieve the best outcomes for the county’s children and young \\npeople by working with a range of partners. It will use its role \\nto engage, influence, coach and support schools and education \\nproviders to collectively achieve these ambitions.\\n•  Improving outcomes and opportunities for all children, young \\npeople and our vulnerable adults should not be determined by \\nwhere people live; strong provision and outcomes should be \\naccessible for all.\\n•  The Education and Learning Strategy should not be viewed \\nin isolation. It should be viewed alongside the strategic '),\n",

The strategic priorities forming the Education and Learning Strategy \\n2023–25 cover seven key themes, two of which are learner focused, \\nthree of which provision focus and two of which focus on strategic \\nsupport. Each of the themes is supported by specific workstreams \\nthat contribute towards achieving our education and learning \\ngoals and ambitions for the next two years, and set the foundations \\nto meet the national education policy ambitions for 2030.\\n28.   The seven key themes link both to Our Council Plan 2021–\\n2025 and the broader plans and initiatives embedded in the \\nChildren, Young People and Learning (CYPL) department. \\nDifferent teams will collaborate and coordinate work to \\nensure synergies across all CYPL plans. Only through this \\ncan we fulfil West Sussex County Council’s education and \\nlearning ambitions for our children and young people. \\n29.  To meet the learning ambitions set within the strategy, children \\nneed to feel safe. They need to rebuild relationships and be \\nsupported in addressing the anxieties that may have developed \\nas a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. There are discrete \\nstrategies and plans to support the mental health and wellbeing \\nof our children and the co-ordination of these plans alongside \\nthe strategic workstreams will be crucial.

Improving outcomes and achievement for all children is a \\nkey priority. In 2019, outcomes for Early Years Foundation \\nStage (EYFS) and Key Stage 1 and 2 rose nationally, but \\ndid not rise at the same pace in West Sussex. \\n31.   The gap between disadvantaged pupils and their non-\\ndisadvantaged peers was greater in West Sussex than both \\nregional and national averages at all key stages. In 2019, 52% \\n  \\nof five-year-olds from disadvantaged families in West Sussex \\nhad the health, emotional matur\\nity and skills required to \\nsettle into school, compared to 71% overall (PACEY model). \\nCompared with their peers, 26% fewer disadvantaged pupils \\nachieved the expected standard in reading, writing and \\nmaths. This is wider that the national average of 19%.\\nWest Sussex rank out of 151 local authorities (2019) Rank Quartile\\nOutcomes at the age of five years \\n(EYFS Good level of Development %) 71 B\\nOutcomes at the age of se\\nven years (Key Stage 1)\\nReading – expected standard 66 B\\nWriting – expected standard 87 C\\nMaths – expected standard 99 C\\nOutcomes at the age of 11 years (Key Stage 2)\\nReading, Writing, Maths (Combined) – expected standard 107 D\\n32.

There are groups of learners who do not achieve as well as they \\nought.

There has been significant \\nsuccess of our School Effectiveness Strategy 2018–22 and \\npartnership working in tackling underperforming schools. \\nThe proportion of schools deemed ‘good’ or ‘outstanding’ in \\nNovember 2022 reached 91.4% with 93.6% of West Sussex \\nchildren attending schools that are ‘good’ or ‘outstanding’ . This \\nmarks the highest proportion on record in West Sussex.\\n35.  The 2022 Key Stage 2 national assessments saw a closing of the \\nattainment gap between disadvantaged pupils and their non-\\ndisadvantaged peers in West Sussex. However, overcoming \\nthe barriers to success remains an essential priority if our \\ndisadvantaged children are to fulfil their learning potential. \\nThis includes groups of children and young people who are \\nparticularly vulnerable, for example, the children we care for, \\nasylum seekers, young carers, children with SEND, those not in \\neducation, employment or training (NEET), those both subject to \\nYouth Justice oversight, and those at risk of criminal exploitation. \\nIt is crucial that they have access to high quality learning that \\nis both appropriate to their needs and assures their future \\nindependence and access to continued learning or employment. \\n36.   Building on the White Paper, Opportunities for All (2022), support \\nfor schools in tackling persistent absence is recognised as crucial \\nin ensuring that young learners maximise the opportunities \\navailable for them in school. The local authority has a statutory \\nduty to provide a multi-agency partnership with schools to \\nimprove the attendance of children and tackle persistent \\nabsence. Improving attendance is a key priority as increasing \\nnumbers of children and young people struggle to return to \\nthe routine of learning and school attendance post COVID-19.\\n37.   It is important that the council supports schools and families \\nto reduce exclusions and suspensions by helping to identify \\npupils through a multi-agency approach.

The SEND & Inclusion Strategy 2019–2024, has been a key driver \\nfor improving provision and outcomes for children with special \\neducational needs. There are three priorities:\\n•   knowing our children and families well (an inclusive person-\\ncentred approach);\\n•   meeting the needs of our children and young people through our \\nschools, education settings and services;\\n•  working together towards solutions (collective responsibility). \\n39.  The growing culture of inclusive practice through improved \\ntools and support has led to 486 children staying at their \\nmainstream school rather than travelling to an independent \\nspecial school. An ambitious SEND Capital Sufficiency Plan is in \\nplace to create over 500 new specialist places in the county’s \\nschools and academies over the next five years, subject to \\nthe financial constraints and increasing construction costs.  \\n40.   We have introduced ‘Therapeutic Thinking’ and are seeing a cultural \\nchange in how schools manage children exhibiting complex \\nbehaviours. It focuses on how all children and young people can be \\nsupported in terms of their emotional wellbeing and mental health. \\nThe approach helps professionals to understand how to respond if \\na pupil is communicating through inappropriate behaviours. Lots of \\nwork around transitions between settings and schools, alternative \\nprovision has been developed, and we have improved data analysis \\nof future need. Stakeholders highlighted the need to maintain the \\nfocus and scope of the SEND Strategy and to continue with the \\nwork. Any changes arising from the outcomes of the SEND Green \\nPaper consultation, and any changes to the Ofsted process of SEND \\nArea Reviews, will be reflected in future work.\\n41.   The assessment of children with special educational needs and \\nsecuring appropriate provision to meet these needs is significant. \\nIt is delivered against increasing demand and financial pressure, \\ncreating constraints.'),\n",

There is a diverse landscape of education providers in West Sussex \\nwhich generally brings a strong quality of provision, with the \\nhighest number being rated ‘good’ or ‘outstanding’ . However, there \\nare inequalities between districts and localities, especially regarding \\naccess to a diverse range of high quality and appropriately targeted \\npre and post 16 vocational courses. Accessing a full range of good \\ncurriculum subjects and pathways currently depends on where the \\nyoung person lives. Tackling this inequality is morally the right thing \\nto do. It is important for us to work with further education providers \\nand plan for a diverse range of opportunities and courses across the \\ncounty, despite limited responsibility held by the local authority. \\n43.   The pandemic and current cost of living pressures are having \\nan impact on recruitment and retention in school and early \\nyears provision. Job vacancies to support children with SEND \\nin schools are becoming increasingly difficult to fill. Financial \\npressures on early years settings are leading to challenges \\nin recruiting and retaining a high quality and experienced \\nworkforce. In both cases, this inhibits some of our youngest \\nand most vulnerable children from being able to access high \\nquality provision. A county wide recruitment plan to support \\nthe development and retention of a well-qualified workforce \\nis crucial in sustaining good quality provision into the future.  \\n44.   The COVID-19 pandemic has created many challenges, but also \\nfacilitated schools to look at new ways of engaging children \\nand young people through online and virtual learning. This \\ncreated a diverse range of teaching approaches and practices \\nwhich have led to engaging pupils in new and exciting ways. '),\n",

The Education White Paper: ‘Opportunities for All’ , signposted an \\nambition that all schools should be part of a partnership with \\na strong Multi Academy Trust (MAT), or with plans to be so, by \\n2030. The full impact of the withdrawal of the Schools Bill (2022), \\nwhich aimed to provide the legislation to enact key provision \\nwithin ‘Opportunities for All’ , is to be clarified at the time of \\nwriting. However, West Sussex County Council is committed to \\nsupporting schools to make informed choices on their future \\norganisational structures. Part of this includes enabling strong \\ncommunities of schools, whether these take the form of localities, \\nmaintained school partnerships and federations, or MATs. The \\nWhite Paper defined strong partnerships or MATs as being \\ninclusive, providing good outcomes and with the capacity to \\ngrow and support underperforming schools. An optimum of 10 \\nschools (or 7,500 learners) is deemed by the DfE to an indicator \\nof a strong MAT. West Sussex is well behind the curve on this \\nwith small or single academies being the most prominent. The \\ncouncil has a strategic role to play enabling a diverse range \\nof partnerships which include the provision of strong MATs as \\nwell as exploring the possibility of a council led MAT. We are \\ncommitted to ensuring all maintained schools are aware of their \\nfuture options to be part of a strong federation, locality, or MAT. \\nIt will require significant work in partnership with the DfE, MATs, \\nstrategic partners (including Diocesan authorities), and both \\ngovernors and headteachers of the council’s maintained schools.\\n46.

Sustainability of early years provision in some \\ncommunities is at risk. Primary schools also face a challenging \\nfuture.

The adult skills agenda is very broad, and leadership is \\ndriven by business representatives, training and further \\neducation sectors, and skills agencies all working to secure \\nemployability. A separate Skills Strategy with its own \\ngovernance and links to the business sector and a Pan Sussex \\nview is crucial. This will be set out separately in due course. \\n52.

If you are eligible for the Extended FE you will receive an eligibility code. \\nYou should present this to your childcare provider along with your National Insurance number(s), \\nyour child’s birth certificate or passport as proof of date of birth. Children are only eligible for the \\nExtended FE once they reach the age criteria and the term following receipt of the validity code from \\nthe Government. \\nI am unable to provide proof of ID and date of birth for my child.

Please contact the Family Information Service to discuss what other acceptable \\nevidence you could provide. \\nAre children without British citizenship eligible for FE? \\nYes, funding of a child is not dependent on citizenship of a parent or child. A child moving to England \\nfrom another country is entitled to Universal FE on the same basis as any other child, regardless of \\nwhether they have British citizenship. \\nIf you are a non-EEA national, you must have recourse to public funds in order to access the \\nExtended Entitlement. \\nHow often do I need to fill in a Parental Declaration form? \\nYou must complete one form for each childcare provider that will provide FE for your child. \\nAdditional boxes exist on the form to capture any subsequent changes to addresses, or hours \\nclaimed and you will be required to sign any updates.

There should be no charge for any FE hours. Childcare providers can charge for additional \\ntime that the child attends, but additional paid for hours cannot be a condition of the place. \\nHow should my childcare provider show the FE on my invoices? \\nProviders should be able to show you a sample invoice and explain how charges are calculated and \\ndisplayed. However, the invoice should never show your free hours as a monetary value. Childcare \\nproviders should supply clear, written information about any fees or charges for additional services, \\nor additional time taken over and above the FE. Any fees charged for additional time must be at the \\nstandard rate of the childcare provider and should not be more than those charged to parents \\nwhose children do not access a free place. \\nCan my childcare provider charge for additional services? \\nChildcare providers can charge for additional services but parents should not be required or \\nexpected to take them up in order to access a free place. Parents should be advised by the provider \\nof any additional costs and an explanation of what they are for, before the child takes up the place. \\nChildcare providers should provide an itemised bill stating clearly what is being paid for and what \\nhas been received free. \\nIf the FE hours include lunchtime then the setting can charge for any meals they provide, but not for \\nthe time. Parents should be given the option of providing a healthy packed lunch instead. \\nConsumables such as paper and paints cannot be charged for, though some providers may ask for a \\nvoluntary donation for such things. This must be voluntary and not a condition of accessing the FE at \\nthe provider. \\n• Optional = optional services are additional ‘options’ that you can opt in or opt out of, such as \\nlunch, snacks, nappies etc. They are optional because if you opt in you pay the setting to \\nprovide them. If you opt out you don’t pay but you must provide these for your child. \\n• Voluntary = voluntary contributions can be asked of you for the general support of the \\nsetting – like a donation. This can be for things such as paper, paints, post-its and general \\ndelivery of the EYFS. They are voluntary because you are not obliged to pay, but if you do \\nnot pay, you also do not have to provide these for your child. The setting is still required to \\nprovide these items for your child whether you donate or not. \\nExtras such as uniforms, book bags, branded items etc. are also voluntary as they are not an EYFS \\nrequirement, however, if you don’t pay for them, the setting does not have to provide them. \\nI want to access Universal/Extended FE but my provider is asking for a deposit. Can they do this? \\nYes. Under Government rules, providers can charge a reasonable, refundable deposit for funded \\nplaces for 3 and 4 year-olds. This is a separate deposit to one that may be charged by a provider for \\nany additional services booked with the provider. Deposits for additional services are a private \\nmatter between parents and providers and the provider sets their own rules as to when and how \\nadditional service deposits are refunded. \\nAre the FE hours restricted to particular times of day? \\nEach childcare provider can stipulate where the funded hours fall during the day if they wish, \\nproviding they meet the requirements set out in the Statutory Guidance from the Department for \\nEducation. These include the following parameters: '),\n",

Parents must complete a FE Parent Declaration Form at each \\nchildcare provider, on which there is a section to show that hours are also claimed at another \\nchildcare provider. For example, a child could attend a FE registered breakfast club and nursery \\nbased on one site or a maintained school and Private, Voluntary or Independent provider on two \\ndifferent sites. However, it is important to bear in mind the impact of multiple providers on a child’s \\nlearning, development and wellbeing. \\nIf you are splitting your offer between providers, you will need to provide your eligibility code and \\ninformation to each provider. If eligible for the Extended FE, you must also choose which provider(s) \\nyou wish to continue to use your Universal FE with, if you were to become ineligible for the \\nExtended FE. Some childcare providers may choose to give priority to children that attend for the \\nwhole week. \\nDoes FE only cover 38 weeks of the year? \\nIf your provider offers funding over more than 38 weeks per year, the total funded hours can be \\n‘stretched’ across the whole year. Depending on your providers method of claiming the total hours \\nyou can claim over the year may consequently reduce, as the funding can only be claimed from \\nWSCC in half hourly increments. Please see examples in grid below: \\nWeeks \\nper \\nyear \\nHours per \\nweek (2 year \\nold \\nFE/Universal \\nFE) \\nTotal hours across \\nthe year (2 year old \\nFE/Universal FE) \\nHours per \\nweek \\n(Universal \\n+ \\nExtended \\nFE) \\nTotal hours \\nacross the year \\n(Universal \\n+ Extended FE) \\n38 15 570 30 1140 \\n45 12.5 562.5* 25 1125* \\n51 11 561* 22 1122* \\n*The remainder of hours cannot be claimed if your setting claims standard stretched funding. \\nAlternatively, your provider can claim over 38 weeks per year but ‘self-stretch’ the hours according \\nto a pre-arranged agreement between your provider and yourself. All rules still apply when this \\nmethod of claiming is used, including the maximum of 15 or 30 hours per week. All hours claimed \\nmust be delivered to the child (with the exception of child sickness or planned short term holidays). \\nIf you wish for your child to access FE hours over more than 38 weeks you must discuss this with \\nyour provider before starting your claim so you are aware of any potential loss in free hours. Please \\nnote that not all providers offer these stretched methods of claiming. '),\n",

Will they still be funded at the new \\nprovider? \\nYes, funding for both Universal and Extended FE should follow the child to the new childcare \\nprovider, calculated from the date at which any contractual notice period finishes. You should ask \\nyour current childcare provider to forward the balance of the funding to your new childcare \\nprovider. It is the childcare provider’s responsibility to provide a clear statement of admissions \\n(including notice period) and term dates for the year, to parents prior to securing a place for their \\nchild. Parents are expected to honour notice periods agreed to, however there are occasions when \\nthis is not in the best interests of the child. If a parent has not kept to a notice period WSCC will \\nacknowledge a notice period of no more than one month relating to transfers of funding. \\nI am moving into West Sussex mid-term. Do I have to wait until next term to get funding? \\nIf your child is eligible for 2 year old or 3 and 4 year old Universal FE, this is considered an \\nexceptional reason for a setting to claim your funding. However, if the child is eligible for 3 and 4 \\nyear old Extended FE, they must wait until the beginning of the following term to access the \\nExtended hours. '),\n",

Occasional sickness, late arrival \\nand planned holidays are acceptable. Two weeks would be a typical family holiday. For longer \\nperiods the circumstances of your family would be taken into account e.g. Four weeks return to \\ncountry of origin would not trigger funding to be reclaimed. \\nIf my childcare provider has an INSET day/Emergency closure do I lose the FE time? \\nINSET days are over and above the 38 weeks entitlement. As such if your childcare provider has a \\nplanned closure during FE time, for example INSET days or bank holidays that causes loss of FE time \\nfor your child then they should offer additional hours to compensate. If they cannot offer additional \\nhours they should be planning their INSET days outside of delivery periods. If they can offer \\nalternatives it's up to them and their parents how many they arrange. In the case of Emergency \\nClosures (e.g. for bad weather) then funding for one or two days closure is not recovered by WSCC. \\nExtended FE (30 HOURS) \\nMy child is going to turn 3 next year. How soon can I access the 30-hours? \\nYour child may be eligible for the Extended FE from the term after they turn 3 and the term after you \\nreceive your eligibility code – whichever is later. \\nFor example, if your child turns 3 on 25 March, and you apply for the Extended FE on 27 March, your \\nchild will be eligible for a place from the start of the summer term. However, if your child turns 3 on \\n25 March but you don’t apply for the 30 hours until 5 April, your child won’t be eligible for a place \\nuntil the start of the autumn term, but can still access Universal FE from the summer term. You can \\napply up to 16 weeks before your child turns 3. \\nDo childcare providers have to offer the Extended FE (30 hours)? \\nNo, like the Universal FE, the Extended FE is optional for providers. This means that your childcare \\nprovider may decide not to offer funded places. Alternatively, they may limit the number of FE \\nplaces they offer. Please note that not all providers may be able to deliver your preferred \\ndays/hours, but this may be achieved by using more than one provider, but no more than two \\nseparate sites in one day. \\nIf I’m not eligible for the Extended FE, can I still get my 15 hours? \\nYes. The 15-hour offer is still universal so if you’re not eligible for an Extended FE place, you will still \\nbe eligible for the Universal FE. \\nWhat happens if I become ineligible for the Extended FE e.g. because I lose my job? \\nIf you no longer meet the eligibility criteria, your child’s Extended FE place will continue to be funded \\nfor a ‘grace period’. You should discuss this with your provider if and when you lose eligibility. \\nOnce the grace period has expired, you will still be eligible for the 15 hours funded Universal FE. If \\nyou have been taking up the Extended FE at two providers, you will continue taking up your \\nUniversal FE place at the provider(s) you named on your Parent Declaration form. \"),\n",

Childcare providers will provide early years care and education that \\nfollows the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) across the whole 30 hours and any additional hours \\naccessed. \\nDo I have to take up the full 30 hours to receive Extended FE funding? \\nNo, if you want to take up less, for example, 25 hours per week, this will still be funded by the \\nGovernment under the Extended FE offer. \\n Tax-Free Childcare  \\nWhat is Tax-Free Childcare? \\nTax-Free Childcare is a Government scheme that allows all eligible parents of children under 12 – or \\n17 if your child has a disability – to open an online account to pay for childcare. For every £8 you pay \\nin, the Government will pay in an extra £2. \\nYou can save up to £10,000 in a Tax-Free Childcare account (£8,000 that you have paid in, plus \\n£2,000 that the Government has paid in) or up to £20,000 (£16,000 that you have paid in, plus \\n£4,000 that the Government has paid in) if your child has a disability. \\nAm I eligible for Tax-Free Childcare? \\nThe eligibility criteria for Tax-Free Childcare is broadly the same as for Extended FE. You can only use \\nTax-Free Childcare to pay registered childcare providers. \\nIt is important to note that, while you can use Tax-Free Childcare alongside Extended FE (or \\nUniversal FE), you can’t use it at the same time as: \\n• Childcare vouchers \\n• Universal Credit \\n• Tax credits \\nResearch your options before deciding what is best for you – for example, some parents may find \\nthey benefit more from being able to use Tax Credits than they would if they switched to Tax-Free \\nChildcare – it depends on your individual circumstances as to what will be best for you and your \\nfamily. \\nMore information is available online. \\nFoster Carers and Extended FE \\nI’m a foster carer, am I eligible to apply for extended FE? \\nFoster carers need to liaise with their social worker to assess whether extended access to childcare is \\nin the best interests of the child. In addition to this a foster carer must also be in receipt of paid \\nemployment or (self-employment) outside of their foster carer role. If both partners are foster \\ncarers both must meet these criteria. If one partner is a foster carer but one is not, the non-foster \\ncarer must meet the usual eligibility criteria for non-foster carer parents. '),\n",

In the case of self-employed foster parents, they need to be able to demonstrate to the Local \\nAuthority that they are actively working but as they do not have to meet an income threshold, \\nfurther details would not be needed. \\nWho is the designated person? \\nSpeak to the child’s social worker in the first instance. The designated person from the Virtual School \\nwill give the final agreement for the Extended FE to ensure that it is in the child’s best interest. \\nI’m a foster carer but my partner is not – am I eligible? \\nThe non-foster carer will have to meet the normal income threshold for Extended FE that is the \\nequivalent of 16 hours at the national minimum/living wage. \\nWhy do foster carers need to reconfirm at all? \\nThis is an extension of Extended FE to children in foster care. The only difference is that foster carers \\nwill need to demonstrate they are working outside their fostering role and that accessing 30 hours \\nwith an early years and childcare provider is consistent with the child’s care plan. These checks mean \\nthere is a parallel application process, but reconfirmation is a normal part of the process to access \\nExtended FE. \\nWhy can’t foster carers apply through the digital childcare service? \\nBefore children in foster care access 30 hours, it is right that a check is made that this is in the best \\ninterest of the child and is consistent with the care plan. Also the criteria for eligibility are different, \\nso applications can’t be made in the same way. \\nIf it is in the best interest of the child, shouldn’t they be able to access Extended FE regardless of \\nthe working status of their foster carers? \\nIf foster carers do not meet the eligibility criteria, local authorities can assess the child’s needs for \\nearly years’ education and childcare as part of the child’s care plan, but this would be funded in a \\ndifferent way. \\nFostering is a huge responsibility and you are forcing foster carers to work and devote less time to \\nlooking after these vulnerable children. \\nWe are not expecting or requiring foster parents to work outside fostering unless they choose to do \\nso and this decision is supported by the fostering service. There is no requirement on the type of \\nwork or number of hours that a foster carer must work in order to access the Extended FE. \\nFurthermore, foster carers will only be eligible if this is consistent with a child’s care plan. \\nWhy did it take so long to enable children in foster care to take up Extended FE? \\nChildren in foster care are some of our most vulnerable children so it was important to get this right \\nto ensure children’s needs are at the forefront of the planning. The Government has consulted \\nextensively with local authorities, independent fostering agencies, foster carers and others in the \\nsector to ensure this can be implemented in way that gets the balance right between support for \\nfoster carers and protecting the welfare of the child.

Should a parent be prosecuted for a \\nchild’s non-attendance, a justifiable defence would be that the school at \\nwhich the child is a registered pupil is not within walking distance of the \\nchild's home, and that no suitable transport arrangements have been \\nmade by the local authority. \\n2.4  The walking distances to be applied are: \\n• 3.218688 kilometres (two miles) in relation to a child who is under \\nthe age of eight and \\n• 4.828032 kilometres (three miles) in relation to a child who has \\nattained the age of eight \\nin each case measured by the nearest available route. \\n  \"),\n",

Young people can leave school on the last \\nFriday in June of the school year in which they reach 16 years of age. \\n3.1.4 The nearest suitable or County Council catchment school is one which \\noffers an efficient full-time education suitable for the age, ability and \\naptitude and any special educational needs of a child (Education Act \\n1996 s.7) and at which the County Council can arrange admission. \\n3.1.5 Where the nearest suitable or County Council catchment school is unable \\nto admit a pupil because the relevant year group is full, transport \\narrangements will be made to the next nearest suitable school with an \\navailable place, provided it is beyond statutory walking distance from the \\nchild’s home address.   \\n3.2 Walking Distance \\n3.2.1 Section 444 of the Education Act 1996 defines walking distance as two \\nmiles for a child under the age of eight years and three miles for a child \\nwho has attained the age of eight. \\n3.2.2 Walking distance is measured by the nearest available route between \\nhome and school using metalled roads, footpaths and any such walkable \\ntrack. \\n3.2.3 Routes are measured from the gate or access to the pupil’s home, or the \\nend of their property nearest to the public highway, to the nearest gate \\nor access to the school/college campus. \\n3.2.4 The courts have defined an available route as one “along which a child, \\naccompanied as necessary, can walk, and walk with reasonable safety to \\nschool.  It does not fail to qualify as ‘available' because of dangers which \\nwould arise if the child were unaccompanied”. Guidance in respect of the \\navailability of a safe route is outlined in Appendix 1 – extract from the \\nPupils’ Panel, 7 March 1989.

Normally, this will be the one registered with the \\nschool as the home address, at which the child would spend most of the \\ntime during school days. Where parents claim that the care is split 50-50 \\nduring term time, transport shall be given from the address of the parent \\nwho receives the child benefit. \\n5.2.2 Assistance with transport will not be given to or from an alternative \\naddress for reasons such as childcare. \\n5.3 Transport granted in error \\n5.3.1 Where transport has been granted to a pupil by mistake, the error shall \\nbe rectified. \\n 5.3.2 Transport shall be withdrawn at the end of the term (as a minimum) in \\nwhich the error is discovered, and the parent notified. In such \\ncircumstances, parents will always be given as much notice as possible \\nand this will be a minimum of one-half term. \\n5.4 Closure or reorganisation of a school \\n5.4.1 In general, when a school closes or is reorganised, only pupils who live \\nbeyond walking distance (see paragraph 3.2.1) from their new school will \\nreceive assistance with transport, provided it is still the nearest suitable \\nor catchment school for their home address.

The financial responsibility for late bus transport rests with \\nschool governing bodies and schools will usually pay operators direct for \\nthe service. \\n5.6.2 Late buses are designed to be flexible, serving main village points and \\nmay not offer the same service as the regular home to school transport. \\nSchools may require parents to be responsible for making any necessary \\narrangements to collect children from points that may be different from \\nthe usual bus stop.  In some cases, this could be more than one mile \\nfrom the usual bus stop. \\n5.6.3 Special arrangements will not be made or funded for children attending \\nwork experience. \\n5.7 Other  \\n5.7.1 Special arrangements will not be made or funded by the County Council \\nif children must be taken home early or come to school late, for example \\nbecause of illness or medical appointments.

An allowance will not be paid to \\nparents who choose to transport their own child, where an alternative is \\navailable. \\n6.1.4 Parents who also transport other entitled children may, by agreement \\nwith the County Council, be treated as voluntary car drivers and receive \\na higher mileage rate. \\n6.2 Lost Tickets \\n6.2.1 Parents are responsible for the cost of replacement tickets.  Parents will \\nbe notified of any such conditions in relation to the issue and use of \\ntickets. \\n6.3 Changes in Travel Arrangements \\n6.3.1 Transport arrangements are kept under review and may be changed \\nfrom time to time.

If so, the roads may be considered \\nsafe. \\n(d) short lengths of road, for instance bridges etc., with no verge are \\nacceptable and the roads may be considered safe. \\n(e) the speed and density of traffic should be considered and if the \\naverage speed and density are reasonable, this will suggest the \\nroads are safe. \\n(f) where there are road crossings, they should be judged in \\ncomparison with roads crossed by pupils using contract buses and if \\ncomparable should be considered safe. \\n5.

This section details how the County Council may help with a \\nchild’s travel to and from school and how parents can support this. \\n The County Council is committed to the principles of inclusion and \\nindependent living.  The ability to travel independently is an important \\npart of preparing children and young people for adulthood.  Whilst we \\nrecognise that for some it will be difficult, many parents can help by \\nusing public transport with their children as much as possible so that \\nthey get used to it as a normal mode of travel.  Parents can help by \\ntraining their children to use public transport independently as they get \\nolder.  Schools and colleges can also help by offering independent travel \\ntraining to help children and young people achieve independent living \\noutcomes in their EHCP.  Wherever possible, we would expect children \\nand young people to travel to and from school or college independently. \\n2 West Sussex County Council provides assistance with transport in \\nthe following circumstances: \\n2.1 Children up to the age of 16 \\n Usually, it is the parent's responsibility to ensure that children are taken \\nto and from school in safety.  However, the County Council will provide \\nassistance with the travel arrangements for children with an EHCPs up to \\nthe age of 16 who live more than three miles walking distance (two miles \\nfor 5- to 7-year-olds) from the nearest suitable school. This could be a \\nmainstream school, a special school or a school with a special support \\ncentre. \\n The County Council will also consider helping with a child’s transport, if \\nher/his SEND are such that s/he is unable to walk to school, \\naccompanied as necessary, even if the child lives within the two/three-\\nmile walking distance.  In the case of children who are wheelchair or \\npushchair users, help may be given where the home to school distance is \\nsuch that it is unreasonable for the child in the wheelchair/pushchair to \\nbe taken to school without the aid of transport.  \\nNote: \\nThe term “parent” throughout this document includes carers. \\n \"),\n",

Parents have the right to ask for a \\nparticular school to be named in their child’s EHC plan (when the plan is \\nfirst drawn up and when West Sussex County Council amends the \\nexisting plan). West Sussex County Council will name that school in the \\nplan unless it would be unsuitable for the child’s age, ability, aptitude or \\nspecial educational needs, or incompatible with the efficient education of \\nothers or the efficient use of resources. Where a child is eligible for free \\ntravel, West Sussex County Council shall take the cost of travel into \\naccount as part of this decision. Travel arrangements may also be \\nrelevant to the decision about the school that should be named in the \\nplan in other ways, for example, the effect the journey may have on the \\nchild and their ability to learn when they arrive at school.  \\n Where naming the parent’s preferred school would be unsuitable for the \\nchild’s age, ability, aptitude or special educational needs, or incompatible \\nwith the efficient education of others or the efficient use of resources, \\nWest Sussex County Council will name a different school that we think \\nwould be appropriate for the child. \\n This means that, where a parent would prefer their child to attend a \\nschool that is further away from their home than the nearest school that \\nwould be able to meet their needs, West Sussex County Council shall \\nconsider whether arranging travel to the preferred school would be \\nincompatible with the efficient use of resources. \\n West Sussex County Council shall determine the cost of providing the \\nchild with free travel to each of the two schools. If travel to the preferred \\nschool would cost more than travel to the nearer school, we shall decide \\nwhether the additional cost of providing travel to the parent’s preferred \\nschool is incompatible with the efficient use of resources. This will include \\ndeciding whether the educational benefits and other advantages the \\nschool will provide for the child outweigh the additional cost. \\n  If West Sussex County Council determines that providing travel to the \\nparent’s preferred school would be incompatible with the efficient use of \\nresources, the local authority may: \\n• name a different school that would be appropriate for the child’s needs \\n(this maybe the nearer school), or \\n• name the parent’s preferred school on the condition that the parent \\narranges the travel or provides some or all the cost of the travel, or \\n• name the parent’s preferred school on the condition that they arrange the \\ntravel (or provide some or all the cost) and name a different school that \\nwould be appropriate for the child’s needs and to which the authority \\nwould provide transport.

The level of risk will vary \\ndepending on the circumstances of each case.  \\n When West Sussex County Council names the parent’s preferred school \\non the condition that the parent arranges or pays for the travel, this \\ncondition should be set out in Section I of the plan.  \\n Where in such circumstances the parent’s circumstances subsequently \\nchange and they are no longer able to arrange or pay for the transport, \\nWest Sussex County Council may conduct a review of the EHC plan to \\nreconsider whether naming the parent’s preferred school is incompatible \\nwith the efficient use of resources. If we determine that providing travel \\nto the parent’s preferred school would be incompatible with the efficient \\nuse of resources, we may amend the plan to name a different school that \\nwould be appropriate for the child’s needs.  \\n West Sussex County Council shall make clear to the parent that they \\nmay review the school named in the EHC plan if the parent becomes \\nunable or unwilling to arrange or pay for the travel. West Sussex County \\nCouncil will record this information in a formal letter to the parent.  \\nKey points \\n• Subject to the exception set out, the school named in a child’s EHC plan \\nwill be their nearest suitable school for school travel purposes. \\n• West Sussex County Council shall take the cost of travel into account \\nwhen deciding whether it would be incompatible with the efficient use of \\nresources to name the parent’s preferred school in the EHC plan. \\n• West Sussex County Council school travel and special educational needs \\nteams shall work closely together and to engage with one another early in \\nthe process for drawing up an initial EHC plan and when changing the \\nschool named in an existing plan following review. \\n   If a child is not eligible for assistance s/he may be able to travel if there \\nis a suitable contract bus or taxi which has spare places.

A place may \\nhave to be withdrawn at short notice if it is needed for a pupil who has \\nan entitlement, or if the vehicle is no longer needed, or if a smaller \\nvehicle is used.  In this event, parents would have to make alternative \\ntransport arrangements for their child.

(Evidence to \\nsupport grounds of religion or belief will be required and the \\nCounty Council will be guided by the Equality Act 2006 regarding \\ndefinitions.) \\n2.3 Young people aged 16 to 19 attending a school or a further \\neducation college \\n When a young person with an EHCP remains at school beyond the age of \\n16, entitlement to transport will be reviewed.  The County Council will \\ncontinue to provide assistance with transport if it is still considered \\nnecessary because of his or her individual needs.  The County Council \\nmay provide transport for students with SEND (where they have a Post \\n16 EHCP) if they attend the nearest suitable further education college \\noffering the required full-time course or comparable course leading to a \\nrecognised qualification and, in the County Council’s view, transport is \\nconsidered necessary because of individual’s needs. \\n   Where help with transport is agreed, a contribution towards the costs of \\nthe transport to school or college will be made.

It will not normally be provided during \\nthe week if a child is unable to return to school at the beginning of the \\nweek.   \\n Children who are termly boarders will be given help with transport home \\nfor one weekend during each half term, as well as the beginning and end \\nof each half term. \\n2.5      Pupils with more than one residence \\nWhere pupils have more than one residence, such as when parents are \\nseparated and care jointly for their children, transport will be provided \\nfrom just one address. Normally, this will be the one registered with the \\nschool as the home address, at which the child would spend most of the \\ntime during school days. Where parents claim that the care is split 50-50 \\nduring term time, transport shall be given from the address of the parent \\nwho receives the child benefit. \\nAssistance with transport will not be given to or from an alternative \\naddress for reasons such as childcare. \\n \\n3 How West Sussex County Council may help a child with home to \\nschool transport \\n3.1 Individual travel arrangements for children will be managed, where \\nappropriate, through Transport Care Plans.  These plans are drawn up by \\nthe Transport Group in consultation with the school and the parents. \\n3.2 Using public transport services \\n Many children and young people in West Sussex travel to school on \\npublic transport services.  Wherever possible, children with special \\neducational needs, particularly those of secondary school age, will also \\nbe encouraged to travel on public transport.  This independence will help \\ndevelop life and social skills. \\n The Disabled Person’s Bus Pass is available to many children and      \\nyoung people who have special educational needs. This offers free bus \\ntravel   at any time if the journey starts or finishes in West Sussex.  \\n3.3 Transport arranged by West Sussex County Council \\n If the County Council agrees to transport a child to school, it will arrange \\ntransport in the most cost-effective way bearing in mind the needs of the \\nchild.  This may be by coach, minibus, taxi or voluntary driver or by \\nissuing a rail or bus season ticket, as appropriate (or you may be asked \\nto apply for the Disabled Person’s Bus Pass).  '),\n",

If the child requires specialist transport or \\nthere is no existing suitable transport available, logistics may take longer \\nto arrange. \\n Parents and school will be notified of the time and place that the child \\nwill be picked up in the morning and set down in the afternoon and the \\noperator’s telephone number before the transport commences.  It is \\nexpected that, usually, a parent and child will walk a reasonable distance \\n(up to one mile) to the nearest collection/set down point. \\n If the school has a place available for a child before transport can be \\narranged, parents may be asked to transport their child to and from \\nschool on a temporary basis. \\n3.4 Assisting parents to transport their child by car \\n If it has been agreed that a child is unable to walk to school and there is \\nno public transport or special transport arranged by the County Council \\nin the area, the Council may agree to reimburse parents fuel costs if they \\nwish to transport their child to school. This agreement is subject to \\nreview, through consultation, should circumstances or the provision of \\ntransport to the school change. Reimbursement is based on the \\nappropriate rate based on the fuel element of the casual user allowance \\npayable to officers of the council.  The rate is 25p per mile (currently \\nwith a 5p cost of fuel enhancement making a rate of 30p per mile.)  In \\nexceptional cases where a child would otherwise travel alone due to \\nsevere, and complex needs an enhanced rate of 40p per mile (currently \\nenhanced to 45p per mile) may be paid.  These rates are revised from \\ntime to time. \\n Parents who transport their child to and from school are advised to make \\ncontingency arrangements (e.g., arrange for a friend or relative to \\ntransport their child to school) should their transport suddenly become \\nunavailable.  West Sussex County Council is unable to provide alternative \\ntransport on a temporary basis. \\n3.5      Transport between Short Breaks (respite) and school \\n Transport is provided primarily for journeys between home and school. \\nWhere regular Short Breaks are arranged by a local authority social \\nworker, the Transport Group will arrange transport to take a child to the \\nrespite care address and pick him or her up the following morning. \\nTransport will be arranged as required and will be subject to funding \\nhaving been authorised through the Child Disability Team. \\n3.6 Journeys for which West Sussex County Council is unable to \\nprovide assistance \\n The County Council does not provide transport or assistance for journeys \\nsuch as: \\n• those which are part of the school curriculum; '),\n",

It may help to reassure \\nparents that whatever form of transport assistance is provided, their \\nchild’s safety and welfare are always the County Council’s priority.  In \\nparticular, the County Council will seek to ensure that: \\n• vehicles are carefully checked and maintained; \\n• drivers and escorts have undergone checks through the Disclosure \\nand Barring Service; \\n• drivers and escorts carry identity cards; \\n• drivers, escorts and operators are aware of their duties, \\nparticularly in emergency situations; \\n• wherever possible regular drivers are used; \\n• escorts are trained and are familiar with safety and emergency \\nequipment; \\n• parents are informed of changes in pick-up and set-down times; \\n• concerns about medication are addressed through implementation \\nof the Transport Care Plan. \\n5.2 Special seats, harnesses and equipment \\n Where a child or young person needs to travel in a wheelchair, it must be \\nsuitable, both for their needs and for transport. Headrests must be \\nprovided with the wheelchair if advised necessary.  Please note that the \\nCounty Council will not pay for the provision of such headrests.  \\n If medical advice indicates that a child requires a special seat or harness \\nin the vehicle, it will be provided or arranged by the County Council, \\nalthough parents will be expected to make available any specialised \\nequipment that has been provided by West Sussex County Council or the \\nHealth Services.

Escorts are \\nusually provided to supervise a group of children and in rare cases, an \\nindividual.  \\n At home pick-up points it is the responsibility of parents to lift children in \\nand out of vehicles, where necessary.  However, escorts will always give \\nreasonable assistance where possible. \\n5.4 Behaviour on the Vehicle \\n For reasons of health and safety, seat belts must be worn where fitted.  \\nIn addition, children and young people must not: \\n• smoke on school transport; \\n• drop litter inside the vehicle; \\n• eat or drink on the vehicle, unless directly supervised by the \\nescort/driver and only when the vehicle is stationary; \\n• stand up or move around in the vehicle whilst it is moving. \\n All personal equipment, e.g., musical instruments, laptop computers, \\nmobile phones etc., should be secured in a suitable school bag. \\n If a child or young person causes damage to a vehicle, the operator may \\nrequire parents to reimburse them for any repairs. \\n If a child misbehaves persistently on a school vehicle, West Sussex \\nCounty Council reserves the right to take appropriate action to protect \\nother users of the service.  This may involve, among other steps, asking \\nthe school to take disciplinary action against the child. \\n6        Vehicle breakdowns \\n6.1  If the vehicle breaks down, the driver will call for assistance. Children will \\nnormally wait in the vehicle, with the driver and/or escort, until a \\nreplacement vehicle arrives. \\n7        Parental Support \\n7.1 We welcome the support of parents in ensuring the smooth running of \\ntheir child’s transport arrangements by: \\n• letting us know if there are any changes to your child’s needs \\nwhich could affect transport, e.g., a recent medical diagnosis, a '),\n",

The \\ntransport will wait no more than five minutes after the scheduled \\npick-up time; \\n• always being at the set-down point to meet their child at the end \\nof the day (unless they travel independently). \\n(If a responsible adult is not at home or at the pick-up point to \\nmeet their child, he or she will not be left but taken to a place \\nof safety from which parents must collect the child.)  \\n• advising the escort and/or the driver in respect of any help they \\nmay require in lifting their child in and out of the vehicle; \\n• telephoning the transport operator and/or escort as soon as \\npossible if their child is sick or unable to attend school for any \\nreason;  \\n• advising the escort and/or the driver if there may be a particular \\ndifficulty with their child on a specific day; \\n• ensuring that their child understands the standard of behaviour \\nthat is expected of him/her, whilst travelling to and from school; \\n• completing any questionnaires requested by the County Council. \\n7.2 Feedback \\n We welcome feedback from parents about any concerns or suggestions \\nfor improving the transport arrangements for their child.

Background \\n1.1. The School Admissions Code (2021) is statutory guidance that applies \\nto all admissions to all maintained schools in England and can be found on \\nthe DfE website.  \\n1.2. The non-statutory advice from the Department for Education (DfE) on \\nthe admission of summer born children can be found on the DfE website.   \\n1.3. This process does not cover pupils who have a n Education, Health \\nand Care Plan. Consideration of admission outside their normal age group \\nfor these pupils needs to be made by the Special Educational Needs \\nAssessment Team.  \\n1.4. The School Admissions Code states:  \\n“Admission authorities must make clear in their admission arrangements \\nthe process for requesting admission out of the normal age group.” \\n1.5. For the purposes of this document the following descriptions are  \\nused:  \\na. A ‘delayed admission’ describes when a child starts school having reached \\nstatutory school age and starts outside of their chronological year group.  \\nb. A ‘ back-classing’ arrangement describes when a child who has already \\nbeen in receipt of education repeats an academic year and is therefore \\neducated outside of their chronological year group. This will include where a \\nchild has had a ‘delayed admission’ and are now transferring to junior or \\nsecondary school.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nc. An ‘ acceleration’ arrangement describes when a child who has already \\nbeen in receipt of education advances a n academic year and is therefore \\neducated outside of their chronological year group. It would be rare for a \\npupil to have an acceleration arrangement from the September of their \\nfourth birthday but consideration will be made under the acceleration \\narrangement.  \\nd. A ‘deferred admission’ describes when a pupil has a school place in line \\nwith their normal age group in the September following their fourth birthday \\nbut only attends on reaching statutory school age and prior to the end of \\nthe academic year. A parent’s decision to defer the admission of their child \\nshould be done following discussion with the school. \\n1.6. Admission authorities must provide for the admission of all children in \\nthe September following their fourth birthday. Under these arrangements: \\na. the child is entitled to a full -time place in the September following their \\nfourth birthday; '),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data-WordWizards/admission_of_children_outside_their_normal_year_group.pdf', 'page': 1}, page_content=' \\n \\nb. the child’s parents can defer the date their child is admitted to the school \\nuntil later in the school year but not beyond the point at which they reach \\ncompulsory school age and not beyond the beginning of the final term of \\nthe school year for which it was made; and \\nc. where the parents wish, children may attend part -time until later in the \\nschool year but not beyond the point at which they reach compulsory \\nschool age. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n1.7. The parents of a summer born child  (all children born from 1 April to \\n31 August) may choose not to send the child to school until the September \\nfollowing their fifth birthday and may request that they are admitted out of \\ntheir normal age group – to reception rather than year 1.  This is described \\nas a delayed admission.  \\n1.8. Should a parent of a summer born child wish to only apply for a \\nschool place in the normal age group when the child reaches statutory \\nschool age then an in -year application should be made and further details \\non this can be found on the website. \\n1.9. Decisions on delayed admissions, back -classing or acceleration \\narrangements will be taken by West Sussex County Council (WSCC) where \\nit is the admission authority for the scho ol. Admission authorities for other \\nschools will have their own arrangements to consider these requests.  \\n1.10. The decisions will be made in line with the non -statutory advice from \\nthe DfE.  \\n2. Further Guidance to Parents \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n2.1. It is expected that the majority of children will be educated within \\ntheir chronological year group.  \\n2.2. Most parents are happy for their child to start school in the \\nSeptember following their fourth birthday. \\n2.3. Pupils will usually be placed with their own age group and be \\neducated for the majority of their time with their peer group. The \\ndifferentiated curriculum usually addresses any particular issues.  \\n2.4. The admission authority will make its decision in accordan ce with the \\nSchools Admission Code and the advice of the h eadteacher. Consideration \\nwill be given to any specific medical or educational needs of the child.  \\n2.5. The Pupil Admission Manager will consider all requests for back \\nclassing and acceleration. The views of the Headteacher of the schools \\nnamed on the form will be sought as part of the decision making process.  \\nThe manager will consult with  other professionals, such as the Principal \\nEducational Psychologist, as necessary.  \\n2.6. Teachers are skilled at differentiating the curriculum to meet a \\ndiverse range of needs. Before deciding to delay their child’s entry to \\nschool, we would recommend that parents visit the schools they are '),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data-WordWizards/admission_of_children_outside_their_normal_year_group.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content=' \\n \\nthinking of applying for. The teachers will be able to explain the provision \\non offer to children in the reception class, how it is tailored to meet  the \\nneeds of the youngest pupils and how the needs of these pupils will \\ncontinue to be met as they move up through the school. They may also be \\nable to allay any concerns the parent may have about their child’s \\nreadiness for school. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n2.7. It is also important to note that, whether they attend a primary \\nschool or an early years setting during the academic year following their \\nfourth birthday, children will receive the Early Years Foundation Stage \\ncurriculum which is largely based around learning through play. \\n2.8. One admission authority cannot be required to honour a decision \\nmade by another admission authority on admission out of the normal age \\ngroup. \\n2.9. Once a child has been admitted to a school it is for the headteacher \\nto decide how best to educate them. Any consideration to move a child to a \\ndifferent age group should be based  on sound educational reasons and \\nmade by the headteacher in consultation with the parents. \\n2.10. Where a child has been educated out of their normal age group, the \\nparent may again request admission out of the normal age group when \\nthey transfer to junior or s econdary school. It will be for the admission \\nauthority of that school to decide whether to admit the child out of their \\nnormal age group. They must make a decision on the basis of the \\ncircumstances of each case and in the child’s best interests, and will need \\nto bear in mind the age group the child has been educated in up to that \\npoint. \\n2.11. If a child is educated outside their normal age group (i.e. is in year \\n10 when this date is reached) the child will no longer be of compulsory \\nschool age during the school  year in which most children take their GCSE \\nexaminations and cannot, therefore, be obliged to attend.  Whilst t he \\ngovernment has changed the law so that all young people will be required \\nto continue in education or training until their 18th birthday the date on \\nwhich they cease to be of compulsory school age has remained unchanged.  \\n \\n \\n \\n2.12. Parents do not have a right of appeal if they have been offered a \\nplace and it is not in the year group they would like. However, they may \\nmake a complaint about  an admission authority’s decision not to admit \\ntheir child outside their normal age group.  They may also make such a \\ncomplaint if they have not made, or do not yet know the outcome of, their \\nformal application for a school place. All schools have a duty t o consider \\ncomplaints about the school and must have a published complaints \\nprocedure in place. Local authorities will also have a complaints procedure.  \\nIf a parent is unhappy with the way a local authority or maintained school \\nhas handled their complaint,  the parent may then refer their complaint to \\nthe Local Government Ombudsman. \\n '),\n",

Delayed Admission Request \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n3.1. To consider a ‘delayed’ admission parents the DfE states it is \\nreasonable for admission authorities to expect parents to provide them with \\ninformation in support of their request as it unlikely to be able to make a \\ndecision on the circumstances of the request without it. If parents have \\nprofessional evidence then it is appropriate to submit this but there is no \\nexpectation that parents obtain profession al evidence that they do not \\nalready have.  \\n3.2. To support the decision-making process WSCC requests that parents \\ncomplete a Delayed Admission Request form. The form can be found on the \\nwebsite. \\n3.3. The Pupil Admission Manager will consider all requests for delayed \\nentry. \\n3.4. In line with the DfE’s advice on the admission of summer born \\nchildren, parents are strongly advised to make an application for their \\nchild’s nor mal age group at the usual time  and submit a request for \\ndelayed admission to school.  \\n3.5. Where a parent’s request for a delayed admission for their child has \\nbeen agreed and, as a consequence of that decision, the child will be \\nadmitted to a relevant age group (i.e. the age group to which pupils are \\nnormally admitted to the school)  WSCC will process the application as part \\nof the main admissions round, unless the parental request is made too late \\nfor this to be possible, and on the basis of th eir determined admission \\narrangements only, including the application of oversubscription criteria \\nwhere applicable.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n3.6. Parents have a statutory right to appeal against the refusal of a place \\nat a school for which they have applied. This right does not appl y if they \\nare offered a place at the school but it is not in their preferred age group. \\n \\n4. Back-Classing  \\n4.1. To support the decision-making process headteachers, in conjunction \\nwith parents, should complete a Back -classing Request Form. The form is \\navailable from the Pupil Admissions Team. \\n4.2. Schools seek to meet the individual needs of pupils by using a range \\nof teaching strategies, calling on additional support and advice as \\nappropriate from colleagues within the school a nd th e external support \\nservices.   \\n4.3. The effective use of differentiated teaching programmes should \\nensure that back -classing only needs to be considered in very unusual \\ncircumstances such as when a child’s education has been severely \\ndisrupted by a long-term absence through illness.  '),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data-WordWizards/admission_of_children_outside_their_normal_year_group.pdf', 'page': 4}, page_content=' \\n \\n4.4. If it is apparent that the pupil is not making appropriate progress, or \\nis experiencing learning difficulties, the school should implement a \\nprogramme of support. A full record of the child’s needs and the \\neffectiveness of th e action taken to meet them should be kept. It is \\nexpected that special educational needs will be addressed by providing \\nadditional support from within the school with the assistance of external \\nsupport agencies, without the need for back-classing.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n4.5. To ho ld back a pupil for a further year, whilst his/her former \\nclassmates move on, may have significant implications for the child which \\ncould have a detrimental effect on his/her overall progress.  \\n4.6. The full implications of any proposals must be considered bef ore they \\nare finalised, particularly as action taken for a child at primary school may \\nwell have consequences at the time of transfer to secondary school. It is \\nalso important to avoid, wherever possible, the situation arising whereby a \\npupil reaches statu tory school leaving age and leaves school part way \\nthrough a course of study with little to show for their endeavours.  \\n4.7. Where the pupil’s progress is being affected by factors outside the \\nschool, such as difficult home circumstances, parents /school should seek \\nsupport from external agencies.  \\n4.8. Before a decision is reached, it is essential that the full implications of  \\npossible back-classing have been taken into account. In order that all \\nrelevant information may be considered, the headteacher of the current \\nschool/parent ought to seek the views, as appropriate, of the following:  \\na. SEN Coordinator for the school  \\nb. Teaching staff  \\nc. Educational Psychologist  \\nd. Parents (if instigated by the school this must be in agreement with the \\nparent) \\ne. Pupil  \\nf. Pupil Admissions Manager  \\ng. Others, as appropriate  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n4.9. If a decision is made to back -class the child, the child’s name will be \\nplaced on the Local Authority’s register. \\n5. Acceleration  \\n5.1. To support the decision-making process headteachers, in conjunction \\nwith parents, should complete an acceleration Request Form. The form is \\navailable from the Pupil Admissions Team.  \\n5.2. The Local Authority’s guidance on very able pupils advises schools on \\nhow to meet the needs of those who show exceptional ability in one or \\nmore areas of the curriculum. The  usual approach is to extend and enrich \\nthe support for the pupil, and to provide opportunities according to his/her \\nindividual strengths and areas for development. Many pupils may excel in '),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data-WordWizards/admission_of_children_outside_their_normal_year_group.pdf', 'page': 5}, page_content=' \\n \\none or two areas of the curriculum but few will demonstrate exceptional \\nability across a range sufficiently wide to justify acceleration.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n5.3. It may be considered appropriate for the pupil to join an older year  \\ngroup for specific activities, whilst remaining with his/her peers for the \\nmajority of the timetable. This can be equally effective for younger and \\nolder pupils.  \\n5.4. Acceleration, therefore, is likely to be appropriate for only a very \\nsmall number of pupils. Before a decision is reached, it is essential that the \\nfull implications of possible acceleration have been taken into account. In \\norder that all relevant information may be considered, the \\nheadteacher/parent ought to seek the views, as appropriate, of the \\nfollowing:  \\na. SEN Coordinator / Able Pupil Coordinator for the school  \\nb. Teaching staff  \\nc. Educational Psychologist  \\nd. Pupil  \\ne. Parent (If this is being instigated by the school the parent must be in \\nagreement before the start of the process) \\nf. Pupil Admissions Manager  \\ng. Others, as appropriate  \\n5.5. If a decision is made to accelerate the child, the child’s name will be \\nplaced on the Local Authority’s register. '),\n",

If your child is registered at a school, then they must attend \\nregularly and punctually.  \\nIt is your responsibility as the parent to ensure your child has good attendance \\nat school and if you fail to do so you can be prosecuted under s.444 EA 1996 for \\nfailing to secure the regular attendance of a child at a school at which they are \\nregistered.   \\nIn relation to education, a ‘parent’ includes any person who has care of a child or \\nwho has parental responsibility. The definition of a ‘parent’ in education law \\nincludes: \\n• All natural parents, whether they are married or not; \\n• Any person who although not a natural parent has parental responsibility \\nfor a child or young person \\n• Any person although not a natural parent who has care of a child or young \\nperson.  Having care of a child or young person means that a person with \\nwhom the child lives and who looks after a child, irrespective of what their \\nrelationship is with a child. \\nAbsences from school \\n \\nOnly the Head Teacher can authorise the absence of your child. There is no \\nautomatic right for a child to be absent from school. The Head Teacher may \\nrequire you to provide evidence of the reason for your child’s absence otherwise \\nthe absence may be recorded as unauthorised.  \\nWhen the Local Authority is notified by a school of evidence of an offence under \\nthe Education Act 1996 we have a statutory duty to respond to this.

Unauthorised absence includes; unauthorised holidays in term time, \\nlate arrival at school, and other absences which have not been \\nagreed/authorised by the school.

There are occasions when a FPN can \\nbe issued outside of these parameters and if this were to occur you would be \\nnotified. \\nThe FPN is a time limited opportunity for the parent to accept guilt/liability for \\nthe offence under the Education Act 1996 rather than the matter going before a \\ncourt.  It offers the chance for the parent to discharge their criminal liability by \\nway of paying a fine.  The fine if for £120 and must be paid within 28 days.  If \\npayment is offered within 21 days of issue, the fine is reduced to £60.   \\nAs the penalty is ‘Fixed’ your financial circumstances cannot be taken into \\naccount.  There is no opportunity for payment plans and/or instalments and the \\npayment period cannot be extended or placed on hold.  In addition, FPNs cannot \\nbe appealed once issued.     \\nFPNs are issued as the Local Authority is clear there is evidence of an offence \\nunder the Education Act 1996.

The weight of any mitigation offered is for the court to decide.   \\nSentencing: \\nIf you have pleaded or been found guilty of the normal Offence, the Magistrates \\nhave the power to impose a fine of up to £1000. If you have pleaded or been \\nfound guilty of the aggravated Offence, you can be fined up to £2,500, be \\nsubject to a community order and/or a term of imprisonment not exceeding \\nthree months. In both cases, costs may also be awarded against you and you \\nwill also have to pay a victim surcharge (the victim surcharge is set by the court \\nin all cases heard).   \\nAll Fines and costs are calculated by considering the elements of the offence and \\nin reference to your income. \\nEducation Supervision Order (ESO) \\n \\nDuring the investigation it may become apparent that it is more suitable for the \\nLocal Authority to apply for an Education Supervision Order (ESO).  These are \\nsought in the Family Court and require the agreement of the parents and the \\nchild concerned to be effective.   If this course of action is proposed you will be \\nfully advised as to what it means, and how it works by the Investigating Officer.   \\nThere is separate information available on ESO’s which can be found here by \\nvisiting: https://www.gov.uk/school-attendance-absence/legal-action-to-enforce-school-\\nattendance \\nOr by making contact with Pupil Entitlement: Investigation:  \\n• Email: pei@westsussex.gov.uk  \\n• Telephone:03302 228200 '),\n",

Regular and punctual attendance at school, or alternative provision, is both a legal \\nrequirement and essential for children and young people to maximise their \\neducational opportunities.  Penalty Notices offer a swift intervention which West \\nSussex County Council (WSCC) will use to deal with issues of unauthorise absence \\nbefore they become entrenched.  \\n3. An offence occurs if a parent/carer fails to secure a child’s regular attendance at \\nschool, or alternative provision, at which they are a registered pupil and that absence \\nis not authorised by the school, or alternative provision.   \\n4. In addition a Penalty Notice can be used to help ensure parents fulfil their \\nresponsibilities to ensure their child is not out in a public place without reasonable \\njustification during the first five days of every exclusion from school.    \\nAuthorisation \\n1.\\n The primary responsibility for the issuing of Penalty Notices rests with the Local \\nAuthority.

Although professionals other than those with the Local Authority (e.g. Head \\nTeachers, the Police etc.) are accredited persons within the legislation, able to issue \\nPenalty Notices, there is no requirement for them to do so.  In West Sussex it has \\nbeen agreed that the Police will not issue Penalty Notices.  If a Head Teacher feels it \\nis appropriate for a Penalty Notice to be issued they must refer to the PEI.  This will \\navoid a Penalty Notice being issued when the PEI is instigating legal intervention \\nproceedings for irregular school attendance or where a Penalty Notice is not deemed \\nan appropriate form of intervention.   \\n3. Penalty Notices will be issued by First Class post to satisfy evidential requirements. \\n4. PEI will act upon requests to issue Penalty Notices from schools, academies, or \\nalternative education providers and Sussex Police, provided that; \\na) All relevant information is supplied in the specified manner; \\nb) The circumstances of the pupil’s absence meets the requirements of this \\nCode of Conduct; and '),\n",

They may be issued for children at maintained schools, academies, free school and \\nalternative provision providers in West Sussex. \\n3. In accordance with the definition of parent, and thereby parental responsibility for \\nnon-school attendance, more than one person may be liable for the offence.  In such \\ncircumstances, separate notices will be issued to each person.  \\n4. A minimum of 10 sessions of unauthorised absence in a 10 school week period will \\nusually have occurred.  However, a shorter period of time may be considered \\nappropriate in some circumstances.   \\n5. Where an authorised officer has reason to believe that a person has committed an \\noffence under S.444(1) Education Act 1996, they may give that person a Penalty \\nNotice. \\nPenalty Notices may be issued when:  \\n• There has been an unacceptable level of unauthorised absence from an \\neducational establishment and enforcement is necessary to improve \\nattendance.  Unauthorised absence is absence not authorised by the school.  \\nThis includes all unexplained or unjustified absences.  The categories of \\nauthorised and unauthorised absence are explained in the Guidance to the \\nEducation (Pupil Registration) (England) Regulations 2006 and further \\nclarified in “School Attendance.   Guidance for maintained schools, \\nAcademies and Independent schools and Local Authorities”.   \\n• In the case of a unauthorised holiday taken during term time, if; \\n\\uf0d8 Parents have not sought permission from the Head Teacher before taking \\ntheir child out of school for a holiday in term time. \\n\\uf0d8 The Head Teacher has refused the request but the absence occurs \\nanyway; or \\n\\uf0d8 A pupil has not returned to school by the agreed date with no satisfactory \\nexplanation.

The purpose of this Code of Conduct is to ensure that the associated powers are \\napplied consistently and fairly across the Local Authority area.  The Code set outs \\nthe arrangements for administering Penalty Notices in West Sussex County Council \\nand must be adhered to by anyone issuing a Penalty Notice.  The Code complies \\nwith relevant regulations and the Department for Education’s (DfE’s) National \\nFramework for Penalty Notices as set out in the  Working together to im prove school \\nattendance guidance.    \\n2. Researc\\nh published by the Department for Education in May 2022 found pupils with \\nhigher attainment at KS2 and KS4 had lower levels of absences over the key stage \\ncompared to those with lower attainment. \\n• Pupils who did not achieve the expected standard in Reading, Writing and \\nMaths in 2019 had an overall absence rate of 4.7% over the key stage, \\ncompared with 3.5% among pupils who achieved the expected standard and \\n2.7% among those who achieved the higher standard. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n• Pupils who did not achieve grade 9 to 4 in English and Maths GCSEs in 2019 \\nhad an overall absence rate of 8.8% over the key stage, compared with 5.2% \\namong pupils who achieved a grade 4 and 3.7% among pupils who achieved \\ngrade 9 to 5 in both English and maths. \\n3. For the most vulnerable pupils, regular attendance is also an important protective \\nfactor and often the best opportunity for needs to be identified and support provided. \\n4. Where difficulties arise with school attendance, professionals should take a ‘support \\nfirst’ approach in line with the DfE’s ‘Working together to improve school attendance’ \\nguidance, only resorting to legal enforcement when necessary.  \\n5. The National Framework for Penalty Notices is based on the principles that Penalty \\nNotices should only be used in cases where:  \\na. Support is not appropriate (e.g., a term time holiday) or where support has \\nbeen provided and not engaged with or not worked, and \\nb. They are considered the most appropriate tool to change parental behaviour \\nand improve attendance for that particular family. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n '),\n",

An offence occurs: \\na. if a parent/carer fails to secure a child’s regular attendance at school, or \\nalternative provision, at which they are a registered pupil and that absence is \\nnot authorised by the school, or alternative provision.  The Penalty Notice is a \\nNotice offering a person the opportunity of discharging any liability to \\nconviction for the offence under S.444(1) Education Act 1996 to which the \\nNotice relates by payment of a Penalty in accordance with the Notice.  \\nb. If a parent/carer fails to fulfil their responsibilities to ensure their child is not \\nout in a public place without reasonable justification during the first five days \\nof every suspension or exclusion from school as outlined in S.103 of the \\nEducation And Inspections Act 2006.   \\n7. The Education (Penalty Notices) (England) Regulations 2007 (and subsequent \\namendments) set out how Penalty Notices for school absence must be used. \\n8. Penalty Notices can only be issued in relation to pupils of compulsory school age in \\nMaintained Schools, Pupil Referral Units (PRU’s), Academy Schools, Alternative \\nProvision (AP) Academies, and certain off-site places as set out in section 444A(1)(b) \\nEducation Act 1996. \\n9. The National Framework for Penalty Notices is published in statutory guidance \\n‘Working together to improve school attendance’. This provides further national \\nguidance on the operation of Penalty Notice schemes for school absence in England.  \\n10. Penalty Notices will usually be issued to the parent or parents with day to day \\nresponsibility for the pupil’s attendance or the parent or parents who have allowed \\nthe absence (regardless of which parent has applied for a leave of absence).  A \\nparent is defined in S.576 Education Act 1996 and includes: \\n \\n \\n \\n \\na. All natural parents \\nb. Any person who is not a natural parent who holds parental responsibility for \\nthe child. \\nc. Any adult who is considered to have care of the child. \\nIn accordance with the definition of parent within the Education Act 1996, and \\nthereby parental responsibility for non-school attendance, more than one person may \\nbe liable for the offence.  In such circumstances, separate Notices will be issued to \\neach person.  Penalty Notices are therefore issued per parent, per child.   \\n11. Penalty Notices will be issued by First Class post to satisfy evidential \\nrequirements/standards.  Any Notice sent in this way is considered legally served by \\nthe Court.  Penalty Notices may also be issued by email should a parent have \\nasserted they will accept this method of correspondence.  \\n \\nAuthorisation \\n12. A Penalty Notice can only be issued by an Authorised Officer; namely a Head \\nTeacher or Deputy or Assistant Head authorised by them, an authorised Local \\nAuthority Officer, or a Police Constable.

Although professionals other than those within the Local Authority are accredited \\npersons within the legislation, able to issue Penalty Notices, there is no requirement \\nfor them to do so.  Within West Sussex it has been agreed Pupil Entitlement: \\nInvestigation (PEI) will issue Penalty Notices for education offences on behalf of \\nschools and the Authorised Officer will be a member of PEI.  This ensures \\nconsistency and will prevent conflict with other enforcement sanctions. \\n \\n \\n \\nCriteria for Issuing Penalty Notices \\n14. PEI will act upon requests made by schools, academies or alternative education \\nprovided and Sussex Police, provided the Governments National Framework \\nthreshold has been met. This is reached when a pupil has been recorded as absent \\nwithout authority for 10 sessions (a school day is made up of 2 sessions) within a 10 \\nschool week period.  Unauthorised absence is evidenced by the presence of one of, \\nor a combination of the following codes in the child’s record of attendance. These \\ncodes are stated in the School Attendance (Pupil Registration) (England) Regulations \\n2024: \\na. Code G – the pupil is absent without permission for the purpose of a holiday. \\nb. Code N – the circumstances of the pupil’s absence have not yet been \\nestablished.   \\nc. Code O – the pupil is absent without Authority and none of the other \\nregistration codes within the 2024 Regulations applies. \\nd. Code U – the pupil attended school after the taking of the register ended but \\nbefore the end of the relevant sessions, and no other code within the \\nregulations applies.   \\n15. PEI will also act upon notifications from schools of incidents of an excluded pupil; \\nCode E - being present in a public place during school hours without reasonable \\ncause.  There National Framework threshold does not apply in these cases. \\n16. If in an individual case the Local Authority (or other authorised officer) believes a \\nPenalty Notice would be appropriate, they retain the discretion to issue one before \\nthe National threshold is met.   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n17. If repeated Penalty Notices are being issued and they are not working to change \\nbehaviour, they are unlikely to be most appropriate tool. The National Framework for \\nPenalty Notices sets out that a maximum of 2 Penalty Notices per child, per parent \\ncan be issued within a rolling 3-year period.  If the National threshold is met for 3rd \\ntime (or subsequent times) within 3 years alternative intervention may be considered.  \\nThis might include prosecution or one of the other attendance legal interventions \\navailable to the Local Authority.  The decision on the type of intervention is for the \\nLocal Authority to decide. \\n18. Where families have moved into the Local Authority enquires will be made with past \\nLocal Authority’s to ascertain if FPNs have been issued for school absence offences. \\n19. For the purpose of the escalation process, previous Penalty Notices include those \\nnot paid (including where prosecution was taken forward if the parent pleaded or was \\nfound guilty) but not those which were withdrawn.  Penalty Notices issued prior to \\n19/08/2024 will not count toward the escalation process.   '),\n",

Schools are required where suitable to issue parents with a Notice to Improve for \\nabsence other than those associated with an unauthorised holiday in term time and \\nwhen a pupil is present in a public place.  This is a final opportunity for a parent to \\nimprove attendance and engage in support before a Penalty Notice is issued.  If the \\nNational threshold has been met and support is appropriate but offers of support \\nhave not been engaged with by the parent or have not worked, a Notice to Improve \\nshould be sent to the parents as a final chance to engage.   \\n21. Schools may choose not to offer a Notice to Improve if they do not expect it to have \\nany impact on a parent’s behaviour (e.g., because the parent has already received \\none for a similar offence) and when this occurs the expectation is for the school to \\naddress their rationale in any referral submission to the Local Authority. \\n22. The recommended length of the improvement period should be between 3 to 6 \\nweeks.  This period is flexible, and a referral may be made to the Local Authority \\nprior to the conclusion of the period, should circumstances dictate e.g., the parent \\nfails to engage and/or the absence continues.  \\n23. It is the school’s decision on what sufficient improvement amounts to.  For example, \\nit might be no further unauthorised absences within the improvement period, or a \\nsufficient amount of improvement tailored to the family.   \\n \\n \\nConsiderations Prior to the Issue of a Penalty Notice \\n24. PEI will consider the following before issuing a Penalty Notice  to ensure consistency \\nof approach: \\na. Holidays in term time (G codes). \\n• W hether a Penalty Notice is the best available tool to improve attendance \\nand change parental behaviour.  Where instances of absences of 15 \\nschool days (30 sessions) or more a Penalty Notice is not offered and \\ninstead the matter is to be referred to the Courts. \\n• Whether the issuing a Penalty Notice in this case is appropriate after \\nconsidering any obligations under the Equality Act 2010.  \\n• Whether it is in the public interest to issue a Penalty Notice in this case \\ngiven the Local Authority would be accepting responsibility for any \\nresulting prosecution for the original offence in cases of non-payment.   \\n \\n \\nb. Unauthorised Absence (O, U & N). \\n• History of attendance of the pupil concerned including previous referrals \\nto the Local Authority.  \\n• Review whether the school has offered proportional support and whether \\nthat support has worked or not, including the communication with parents \\nby phone, letter or in person.   \\n• The level of engagement of the parent/pupil regarding the absences. \\n• The reasons offered by the parent for the absences.

Excluded pupils in a public place. \\n• Evidence of the notification to parents of their responsibilities whilst the \\nexclusion is in place. \\n• Evidence presented in respect of the pupil being in a public place during \\nschool hours. \\n• I nformation relating to any reason apparent/offered for the pupil being in \\nthe public place, to assist in ascertaining if there was reasonable \\njustification. \\n \\n \\n \\nOutcome of Penalty Notices \\n25. The Local Authority will notify the schools of instances where an offered FPN is not \\npaid, withdrawn, or resulted in a prosecution in respect of the offence under S.444 \\nEducation Act 1996.  This notification will be achieved by email contact to the \\nreferring school.   \\n26. Where pupils move between Local Authority areas, West Sussex can be contacted \\non crossborder.PenaltyNotice@westsussex.gov.uk to find out if Penalty N otices have \\nbeen issued previously. \\n27. Wher\\ne pupils attend school in West Sussex and live in a different Local Authority, \\nWest Sussex will liaise with the home Local Authority to advise of the actions taken \\nand outcome.   \\nWithdrawal of Penalty Notices \\n28. There is no inherent right to appeal a Penalty Notice.  Once issued a Penalty Notice \\ncan only be withdrawn in the following circumstance. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n• The Penalty Notice has not been issued in accordance with the Code of \\nConduct. \\n• Evidence has been established the Penalty Notice was issued to the wrong \\nperson. \\n• Material errors have been identified in the information leading to the issue of \\nthe Penalty Notice.   \\n• The period for payment has expired and the Local Authority does not intend \\nto instigate legal proceedings for which the Penalty Notice relates. \\n '),\n",

The Pupil Admissions Team will \\nmaintain a waiting list for community and controlled schools until the end \\nof the summer term in July of the academic year applied for. The waiting \\nlist is ordered if places become available and parents will be offered a \\nplace in the correct order. \\n15.S\\nchools must advise the Pupil Admissions Team of all leavers from all year \\ngroups immediately, so that places can be offered, after allocation until 1 \\nSeptember, when in-year admission processes apply.

All distances are measured by \\na straight line from the school to the child’s home address, using Ordnance \\nSurvey data within the curtilage of the property.  \\n• Where priority is given for a sibling, brothers or sisters may be half or \\nstepsiblings (by marriage or co-habitation) or foster siblings but must be \\nliving permanently at the same address.  \\n• West Sussex County Council only gives sibling priority if the older sibling will \\nbe at the school at the time of application and will still be in the school \\n(years 1-6 for primary and year 8-11 for secondary) at the time of \\nadmission; or if the sibling will be attending the linked junior school in \\nSeptember 2025. It is the parent’s responsibility to tell the Pupil \\nAdmissions Team about sibling links in their application.  \\n \\n \\n  \\n• Siblings of children who have been refused a place at their catchment school \\nbecause the school was oversubscribed at the point of application will be \\ntreated as living in the catchment area for the school allocated when they \\napply for starting school. This will only apply if an application was made for \\nthe catchment school and the place refused in writing. It is the parent’s \\nresponsibility to indicate these circumstances in their application. \\n• West Sussex County Council gives priority to children of staff in either or both \\nof the following circumstances (following section 1.39 of the School \\nAdmissions Code): \\na) where the member of staff has been employed at the school for two or \\nmore years at the time which the admission to the school is made, \\nand/or \\nb) the member of staff is recruited to fill a vacant post for which there is a \\ndemonstrable skill shortage. \\nIt is the parent’s responsibility to indicate these circumstances in \\ntheir application.

We can do this by supporting those \\nprofessionals (especially health workers and early years practitioners) who have \\nuniversal contact with children to be confident in recognising indicators of \\nvulnerability and to know how, when, and where, to obtain appropriate advice \\nand support. \\nThe aim of the Children’s Learning and Well-Being Audit is to ensure that all \\nyoung people are ready for school and ready for work. For our youngest children \\nthis means that we want to improve their readiness for school and ensure that \\ntheir parents and carers are accessing early education, health and family support \\nfrom Early Help and other services. The initial evaluation of the tool has already \\ndemonstrated that this approach can have a positive effect on health, well-being \\nand achievement and have an impact on future school attendance and a \\nreduction in demand for high-cost intervention services from social care and \\neducation.

We all want the best \\noutcomes for every child and identifying, at the earliest opportunity, those who \\nare potentially more vulnerable is essential if we are going to provide the right \\nsupport at the right time to meet their needs and improve their life chances. \\nThe purpose of this document is to ensure that there is adequate support in \\nplace to meet the needs of identified children, and to track their progress. It will \\nbe used as a record of the professional discussion which will take place with you \\nand help to inform any future actions you may take, as well as considering other \\nsupport that may be available beyond your own organisation for the children and \\ntheir families. \\nPractitioners must use professional curiosity ensure they are gathering correct \\ninformation and not just take what they hear at face value. For example, a \\nparent may say that their child has a specific medical condition or that the other \\nparent does not have parental responsibility or access to their child. Consider \\nwhat evidence you would need to have to inform your next steps and support to \\nthe child and family. \\nOn the Children’s Learning and Well-being Audit wepbage, there is a template \\naudit tool which can be used to record the information you have, the decisions \\nyou make, and the actions taken to support children and families. \\nWe recognise that professionals working with early years children and their \\nfamilies already undertake a huge amount of work supporting the learning and \\nwell-being of children and this tool is designed to complement and enhance that \\nwork, by taking a holistic view of the child and their family in support of their \\nlearning. \\nSupporting Children and Families \\nFor the majority of children and families, their needs can be met by universal \\nsupport.

Indicators are divided into Health, Environment \\nand Learning and are then broken down further into Family and Child. \\nOnce one or more indicators are identified it is important that the level of \\nconcern is considered using the West Sussex Continuum of Needs/Threshold \\nGuidance. At this stage, it is important to look at what is already in place for the \\nchild/family and if anything more could be done to support them. If any of the \\nindicators identified have an immediate impact upon a child’s safety, it is \\nimportant that this is referred directly to the Integrated Front Door (IFD). \\nThe Integrated Front Door (IFD) \\nAll enquiries/referrals for both Social Care and Early Help come through a single \\nfront door referred to as the Integrated Front Door (IFD), this is the only public \\ncontact point for Early Help and Children’s Social Care.  The IFD for West Sussex \\nChildren Services ensures that all enquiries and referrals are triaged upon \\nreceipt and directed to the appropriate service to support with the query, \\nproviding a seamless process with children receiving a service proportionate to \\ntheir needs in a timely way.  This expertise of the team comprises of qualified \\nEarly Help specialists, qualified Social Care specialists, qualified managers, \\nCustomer Service Centre Agents and social care referral advisors. \\nIt is important to acknowledge that an indicator could become relevant at any \\ntime, and it is therefore essential that all professionals coming into contact with \\nchildren are aware of the indicators so that support can be provided at the \\nearliest opportunity. \\nIf in your work with children and families, or when using the CLaWBA tool, you \\nidentify and concerns about a child, you should refer to the West Sussex \\nContinuum of Need / Threshold Guidance - (westsussexscp.org.uk) in order to  \\nidentify the level of need and therefore the next steps needed. \\nUniversal needs (Level 1) \\nChildren and young people at this level are achieving expected outcomes. \\nThere are no unmet needs or need is low level and can be met by the \\nuniversal services or with some limited additional advice or guidance. \\nEmerging needs (Level 2) \\nChildren and families with some emerging needs may require support of \\nanother service alongside universal provision to prevent an escalation of \\nneeds. Early Help support may be appropriate for some children at this \\nlevel. \\nComplex Needs (Level 3) \\nChildren and families with more significant complex need and who need \\ntargeted support without which they would not meet their expected \\npotential.

However, what is key is that those with \\nan ASC can be more vulnerable to a whole range of \\nsafeguarding concerns - including individuals and \\ngroups that seek to groom and recruit young people \\ninto extreme and potentially dangerous belief \\nsystems. \\nSome of these vulnerabilities are explored in \\nSection 4 of this guidance booklet, but the \\nobjective of this resource is to equip you as parents \\nwith the confidence and effective strategies to \\nhave meaningful conversations with and develop \\nthe resilience of young people going forwards. \\nConsequently, they will be able to effectively \\nrecognise and counter extremist points of view. \\nThis resource also directs you to a ‘Toolkit’ of \\nhigh quality, adaptable ASC friendly resources for \\nyou to use with young people in order to discuss \\nsome of the themes and issues within this booklet \\nin an appropriate manner. This will hopefully \\nencourage critical thinking and transferable life \\nskills they can draw on in future to build personal \\nresilience to propaganda and concerning beliefs \\nthat may lead them into harm. \\nThis Guidance Booklet and Toolkit was developed \\nwith a range of partners from both Crawley Borough \\nCouncil (CBC) and West Sussex County Council, as \\nwell as a range of organisations and young people. \\nI would like to thank them in so generously lending \\ntheir expertise in order to create this important \\nresource. \\nWe hope that this guidance booklet and toolkit \\nwill help you to understand some of the risks and \\npractically apply the information and ASC specific \\nresources to ensure your child has a reduced risk of \\nharm in this area. \\nAutism affects at \\nleast 1% of the \\npopulation, although \\nit is likely that this is \\nunder-estimated, \\nparticularly in non-males. \\nAutism, UK Parliament, \\nJanuary 2020 \\nSource: researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/ \\ndocuments/POST-PN-0612/POST-PN-0612.pdf \\n6 '),\n",

Make sure you are having regular \\nconversations with your young person about  \\ntheir online activity. Have a look at the  \\n‘Online Safety’ section of this booklet to help \\nyou do this. \\n• All young people need safe spaces to explore \\ntheir own thoughts, ideas and concerns – \\nhelp them to have these conversations by giving  \\nthem time to process their thoughts and really \\nlisten to their points of view. Have a look at \\nthe ‘Having difficult conversations’ section of \\nthis booklet for further advice and support. \\nIf you think a young person might be being \\nradicalised, the most important thing is you \\ncan do is tell someone your concerns.

However, some children and young \\npeople’s needs mean that they are potentially \\nmore vulnerable to being manipulated and \\ngroomed into a violent or extreme ideology.  \\nSome of these vulnerabilities and qualities  \\nwhich terrorist groups may want to exploit  \\ncould include: \\n• Theory of mind – difficulty empathising or \\nunderstanding other people’s perspectives \\nmay stop someone from questioning a radical \\npoint of view or the consequences of an action \\n• Obsessionality/hyperfocusing – fixation or \\nobsessions with particular themes of concern. \\nThis could be linked to counterfeit deviance \\n(inappropriate behaviour born out of social \\nnaivety) causing them to be attracted to \\ndark interests \\n• ‘Black and white’ thinking – radicalisers \\ncould exploit this by making their often simplistic \\nideologies appealing \\n• Social isolation – a consistent risk factor in the \\ncase of violent extremism. Someone with an ASC \\nmay be more likely to experience social isolation  \\ndue to a lack of understanding of the \\nconventions and unwritten rules of social \\nbehaviour, a preference for their own company or \\nunwelcoming or negative past experiences \\n• Social naivety – someone with an ASC may \\nfind it harder to make sense of the social \\nsituation they find themselves in and respond \\nappropriately – as a result they may be unable \\nto figure out others motives and the \\nconsequences of their actions \\n• Critical thinking – someone with an ASC may \\nbe more inclined to think literally and be \\nunable to question the nuances of an extreme \\nideology. \\nSomeone who is particularly high functioning \\nmay have particular skills or abilities that a \\nradicaliser may look to exploit \\n• Hypersensitivity – this can make the techniques \\n(such as games and social media propaganda), \\nsigns and symbols that radical groups use \\nappealing \\n• Learning difficulties – may mean they are \\nunable to challenge what they are being told \\n• Low self-esteem – extremists may target them \\nand draw them in so that they feel they belong \\nwithin their group, before exploiting them. \\nThis guidance booklet and toolkit will aid you \\nin mitigating some of these concerns. \\n16 17 '),\n",

It is believed that “people with ASDs \\n[ASC] like computer-based instruction and find \\nit motivating” (Moore and Calvert, 2001). Digital \\nTechnology comes with many benefits, but there \\nare also risks which are essential to be aware of. \\nThe internet provides the perfect platform for \\nradicalisers to exploit the vulnerabilities that young \\npeople with an ASC may possess, and indeed some \\nresearch has identified that this group is more likely \\nto be radicalised in an online space. The following \\nsections will inform you as to some of these risks, \\nand also help to support you in mitigating these to \\nensure the safety of your young people online. \\nHow the use of technology facilitates \\nradicalisation: \\nInternet enabled devices provide a platform \\nto speak to other people. Whilst this is good \\nin that “computers reduce the discomfort and \\nanxiety that people with ASCs feel in face-to-face \\ninteraction because they can interact in a familiar \\nplace” (Bagatell, 2010), unfortunately it is much \\nharder to distinguish between true friends and \\nfalse friends online. Those with an ASC may be \\neven more vulnerable to this as they could have \\ndifficulty understanding other people’s perspectives, \\nmeaning that they may not question another’s \\nmotives or radical ideologies. They may also have \\ndifficulty reading emotions and understanding the \\nconsequence of their actions on victims and their \\nfamilies. \\nSomeone with an ASC may not understand the \\nconsequences of their actions online, or indeed \\nof a violent or extreme act. However, would \\nbe radicalisers may not always wish to mobilise \\nindividuals to violence. Just as evidence shows that \\nyoung people with an ASC are groomed into non-\\nviolent acts such as computer hacking, someone \\nwith an ASC could be vulnerable to exploitation \\nby terrorists due to their specialised knowledge or \\ntalents. \\nHypersensitivity – the internet is appealing as it \\ncan quickly give you detailed, factual information. \\nThis may appeal to someone with an ASC as they \\nare able to focus on particular interests and gain a \\nsense of order out of a seemingly chaotic world. Yet \\nin an online space they feel that they can simply \\nshut this off when they experience sensory overload, \\nagain making this environment more appealing to \\nthem. However, groomers recognise this and use \\nthe internet to promote their black and white \\nideologies that promise to create order out of \\nchaos. \\nExtreme content – Individuals with an ASC are \\n‘more likely to develop compulsive Internet usage \\nthan individuals without ASC’ (Finkenauer et al., \\n2012). The internet allows individuals to gain a \\nhuge amount of knowledge very quickly. Combine \\nthis with the amount of ‘fake news’ online and \\nindividuals becoming fascinated by dark interests \\n(perhaps due to counterfeit deviance), and this may \\nbecome very dangerous. Individuals may end up \\nhyperfocusing on themes of concerns and being \\nsusceptible to grooming from online extremists. \\nPractical tips to help minimise the risks for \\nyour child online: \\nParental controls \\nParental controls are important to set up – they \\ncan be used to block upsetting or harmful content, \\ncontrol in-app purchases or manage how long your \\nchild spends online. Parental controls can be set up \\non devices and Wi-Fi as well as search engines. \\nIf you become aware that your young person is \\nsearching for inappropriate content online, then \\nhave a conversation with them about why this \\nmay be (you can refer to the ‘Having difficult \\nconversations’ section of this booklet to help you \\nwith this). If you are still concerned following your \\nconversations , then refer to the ‘What do I do if I \\nthink my child is being radicalised?’ to find out \\nwhere you can voice your concerns. \\nThink about if your child uses your phone or device \\nand what they can potentially access if you have \\nmore lax settings on them: \\nInternet Matters: \\nwww.internetmatters.org/ \\nparental-controls \\nNSPCC: \\nwww.nspcc.org.uk/keeping-children-\\nsafe/online-safety/parental-controls/ \\nScreen time \\nIt can be good to consider agreeing limits for time \\nthey spend online.

These have been developed by the Pan \\nEuropean Game Information (PEGI) and give a \\nrecommended age based on the content and its \\nsuitability. Be careful however, as this rating does \\nnot take into account its functionality – such as the \\nability to chat to other gamers. \\nWith tablets and smartphones becoming ever more \\npowerful it is no surprise that video gamers are as at \\nhome on these multifaceted gadgets as they are on \\ndedicated handheld consoles.

This is now simpler \\nwith PEGI ratings being applied to all products in \\nthe Google Play (Android) and Windows stores. \\nAge recommendations/ratings also apply to many \\nsocial media platforms. However, be aware that \\nthere is currently no age verification system in place, \\nso any young person can join a social media site if \\nthey change their birth date to that of at least the \\nminimum required age: \\nPEGI: \\npegi.info/page/pegi-age-ratings \\nRemember, that age restrictions are a guide.

However, in order to \\nbuild their resilience – both offline and online – \\nto some of these issues, it is important that you \\nare able to talk to your young person about \\ntheir concerns and answer any questions they \\ncould have. It may be that they find it difficult \\nto ‘put themselves in someone else’s shoes’ \\nand understand another person’s intentions \\nor personal beliefs; all young people need safe \\nspaces to explore their own thoughts, ideas and \\nconcerns. As parents and carers of these young \\npeople, you play a crucial role in creating spaces \\nto hold open and honest dialogue to prevent your \\nyoung person from becoming involved in risky \\nbehaviour. \\nSometimes a young person may say something that \\nyou disagree with, or that others may find shocking \\nor provocative. The following advice comes from the \\nTim Parry and Johnathan Ball Foundation for Peace \\n(reproduced with their kind permission), and aims to \\nprovide you with a constructive manner of dealing \\nwith the statement, rather than reacting emotively \\nand shutting down debate. \\nParents naturally have a big \\ninfluence on their children’s \\nviews so it’s important to \\nencourage children to see \\nand respect different points \\nof view. \\nEducate Against Hate \\nSource: Educate Against Hate: Top tips to help parents \\ndiscuss radicalisation and extremism with young \\npeople https://educat\\neagainsthate.com/wp-content/ \\nuploads/2020/04/EAH_Par\\nents_Top-Tips_English_AW_ \\nInteractive.pdf \\n1.

What are their \\nneeds? \\n3. Broaden Perspectives \\nExamples of stats, facts and what you can say to \\nopen up different perspectives. What questions \\ncan you ask? \\nTips for having these conversations: \\n• Really listen to their point of view and show \\nthat you value their arguments. Wait for their \\nresponse. \\n• Give them time to process thoughts. \\n• Establish clear ground rules that demonstrate \\nrespect – such as taking it in turns and not \\ninterrupting one another. \\n• Try to stay neutral rather than displaying \\nemotions – even if you are shocked or disagree \\nwith something they say. \\n• Remind your young person to challenge the \\npoint of view – not the person making it. \\n• If you think your young person may be making \\noffensive or unkind comments (remember this \\nmay not be deliberate but instead may be down \\nto social naivety) then it is important to calmly \\nchallenge it and explain why it is unacceptable. \\nExplain how it may make the other person feel \\nand talk about times things have been \\nsaid to them and how it made them feel, so they \\nunderstand the consequences of their comments. \\nYou can also use social narratives to explain why \\ncomments or actions are inappropriate (have a \\nlook in the Toolkit resource to help you with this). \\n• Do not use euphemisms or idioms – speak \\nliterally and use facts. If you unaware of these, \\ncan you look it up together? (From a reputable \\nsource of course!) \\n• Follow up after – make sure they know they can \\ncome talk to you again. Consider using some of  \\nthe resources in the Toolkit section to help \\nfacilitate this. \\nWhat can I do if my young person is \\nconcerned about the ongoing threat or a \\nrecent terrorist attack? \\nThe following online resources may be helpful in \\nhaving these often sensitive and difficult discussions \\nabout violent attacks: \\nLondon Grid for Learning: Talking to \\nChildren about terrorism (For parents/ \\ncarers) \\nNSPCC: How should you talk to \\nchildren about terrorism?

In fact, it encourages that \\nthis is done in a safe space in a proactive and \\nrespectful way. By having these discussions, young \\npeople may understand the risks associated with \\nextremist arguments and learn the skills required to \\nrespectfully recognise, question and challenge views \\nincompatible with shared values. You can use some \\nof the Toolkit resources to help build these skills. \\nMyth: Neither I nor my young person will be \\nlistened to \\nThe most important thing is that your young person, \\nand you, feel listened to and supported. All the \\npeople that could provide support (whether school, \\ncollege, work, county council employee, police, or \\nChannel member) do so in order that your concerns \\nand those of your young person are taken into \\naccount. Their main aim is to keep your young \\nperson safe and prevent them from committing any \\nharm to themselves or others. \\nMyth: There is only support available for some \\nextreme ideologies – no one will care if I ask for \\nhelp \\nPrevent looks at all forms of extremism (in fact – last \\nyear, almost half of the cases referred were due to \\nconcerns about right wing radicalisation), examples \\nof which could include right wing extremism, \\nIslamist extremism, animal rights extremism, or \\neven mixed, unclear or unstable ideology. This \\nmeans that there is no specific belief system \\nidentified, but that the individual is vulnerable \\nenough to still pose a risk to themselves or others \\nin this space. Every concern is carefully considered \\nand, if necessary, support tailored to the individual \\nconcerns. \\nMyth: My child will get in trouble if I report my \\nworries \\nA “clear distinction should be made between \\nindividuals who present with a ‘terrorism \\nvulnerability’ requiring Channel support and those \\nwho pose a ‘terrorism risk’ requiring management \\nby the police.” (Channel Duty Guidance: Protecting \\npeople vulnerable to being drawn into terrorism, \\n2020) \\nUnless your young person has clearly done \\nsomething which constitutes a crime, Channel \\nworks in a confidential and non-criminal space. Yes, \\npolice may work as part of the Channel team, but \\nthey do so in a safeguarding capacity along with \\nother professionals to ensure that individuals are \\nsupported away from harm. The sooner you voice \\nyour concerns, the sooner the support for your \\nyoung person, and the whole family, can be put in \\nplace. \\nMyth: Someone with an ASC is more likely to \\ncommit a violent act \\nThere is absolutely no research to suggest that \\nsomeone with an ASC is more likely to commit \\na violent act than someone who is considered \\nneurotypical. However, what is clear is that someone \\nwith an ASC may have a range of vulnerabilities \\nand specialist talents that a recruiter may wish \\nto exploit in the name of their extremist ideology. \\nFurthermore, someone with an ASC might find \\nit particularly difficult to understand others’ \\nperspectives. It is important that then we help \\nsafeguard our young people from this and develop \\ntheir critical thinking skills so that they are able \\nto question and counter extreme and dangerous \\npoints of view. \\nMyth: My child wouldn’t engage in activity like \\nthis – they know what is right and wrong \\nIt can be difficult for young people in particular \\nto understand what behaviour crosses a line. \\nDepending on what they are using or engaging \\nwith - particularly online - they may come into \\ncontact with people who want to influence them in \\na negative way. They could also unwittingly come \\nacross content that could be harmful, and they \\nmay not have the skills or knowledge to be able to \\nconduct themselves in a way that doesn’t cross any \\nlines. \\nFurthermore, someone with an ASC may have a \\nmore limited understanding of some of the negative \\naspects of society and the risks they pose. The \\nonline space wasn’t created with young people in \\nmind and there are still very limited restrictions in \\nplace to k eep young people safe (e.g. accurate age \\nverifications). Things change quickly and it is the \\nrole of parents or carers to navigate this. \\nIt is really important therefore to have regular, \\nrepeated and informed conversations about online \\nsafety with your young people. Please have a look at \\nthe Online Safety section of this booklet in order to \\nremind yourselves of how you can start having these \\nconversations. \\nMyth: People with autism cannot form \\nrelationships – they are unlikely to get groomed \\nby a recruiter \\nWhilst unfortunately some people with an ASC \\nmay feel more socially isolated, this does not mean \\nthat they do not have a strong desire to make \\nfriends that they can talk to and experience a sense \\nof belonging to certain groups. In particular, an \\nindividual may feel more comfortable online where \\nthey can engage with others in a more predictable \\nand structured environment, and it could be here \\nthat they are befriended by someone who is \\nuntrustworthy and has ulterior motives. \\nHaving a sense of kinship, security and belonging \\napplies just as much to someone with autism as it \\ndoes to anyone else, and unfortunately groomers \\nwill exploit this to draw someone into being \\nradicalised and potentially exploit their talents and \\nskills for their own ends. \\nMyth: Someone with an ASC does not feel \\nor show emotion, so they are unlikely to feel \\nstrongly about a particular ideology \\nWhilst someone with autism may not show \\nemotions in a neurotypical way that people without \\nthe condition may recognise, it does not mean \\nthat they do not have their own thoughts, beliefs \\nand feelings about key issues, people or society. \\nGroomers can of course use this and manipulate \\nindividuals into acting on their behalf. \\nMyth: You can’t change someone’s behaviour \\nUnfortunately, as we have seen, groomers can \\nexploit individuals with an ASC so that they become \\ndrawn into a group’s ideology. As a result, autistic \\nindividuals could change their appearance or \\nbehaviour just as easily as those who do not have \\nan ASC. \\nIf someone is supported through Channel, you may \\nfeel that we are unable to change their concerning \\nbeliefs or interests. However, rather than trying to \\ndo this, it is likely experts will explore their other \\npassions and encourage them away from the \\ndirection of harm, rather than just trying to counter \\ntheir arguments. \\n42 43 '),\n",

He spends a large amount of his time \\nonline at home without interacting much with \\nother people. \\nK received one to one support from an \\nexperienced expert who worked with him to \\nunderstand Daesh and other extremist groups’ \\nrecruiting and radicalising methods and \\nthe risks they present, reflecting on possible \\nconsequences. \\nAs K was quite isolated without many interests, \\nhe received support to find activities to get \\ninvolved in, especially where he could mix with \\nothers. He was also given support regarding job \\nsearching, applications and interviews. \\nK no longer wants to watch the videos or contact \\nanyone associated with them. K understands the \\ndangers of online radicalisation and even warns \\nothers about it. K has developed an interest in \\nastronomy through a relative and is learning to \\ndrive in order to extend his job searching. \\nQuestion: My child knows so much more about the \\ndigital space than me – I can’t keep up – so how \\ncan I ensure they stay safe? \\nDigital technology is ever evolving at such a fast \\npace; it can be a real challenge to keep up with \\nthe latest games and social media platforms \\nand any associated dangers. This can feel really \\noverwhelming. However, what is really key is \\nunderstanding the key principles and actions you \\ncan take to keep your child safe online. You can find \\nthese in the Online Safety section of the booklet, \\nas well as further resources in the Toolkit. To keep \\nyou informed about new emerging issues and \\nresources , use Net Aware, and sign up to our free \\nmonthly Staying Safe online newsletter, where you \\nwill also be able to find out about training sessions \\nspecifically designed for you as parents and carers. \\nQuestion: My young person gets fixated on certain \\ntopics – won’t it be impossible to change their \\nmind? \\nSomeone with an ASC may become particularly \\ninterested in a certain topic and learn a huge \\namount about this interest (this could partly be \\nfuelled by the readily available information on \\nthe internet). This is wonderful as it allows young \\npeople to explore their passions and specific talents. \\nHowever, the issue is if that interest is particularly \\nlinked to dark or violent topics, extreme beliefs, or \\nuseful for radicalisers to exploit. If this is the case, \\nthen support would be put in place, but not to \\nparticularly counter or change that young person’s \\nmind, but instead to open their eyes as to their \\nother interests and topics which may be far more \\npositive and productive for them and their futures. \\nQuestion: It is their school’s job to safeguard \\nagainst this – what can I do? \\nYou are right in that schools and colleges have \\nalways had an important role to play in protecting \\nyoung people from a range of safeguarding \\nrisks – and the threats posed by extremism are \\nno different. It therefore forms part of a school’s \\nstatutory safeguarding responsibilities and they will \\nbe doing all they can to ensure your young person is \\nkept safe. \\nHowever, as their parents or carers, you are likely to \\nknow your child and their needs best and be able \\nto recognise when something may be of concern. \\nIt is all of our responsibilities to ensure vulnerable \\npeople are kept safe. Therefore being alert to any \\nchanges in appearance or behaviour; excessive time \\nspent online; or strange or concerning comments or \\nopinions, and reporting any concerns, will be key in \\nensuring your young person is kept safe. \\nQuestion: Sometimes my young person has \\ndifficulty in transferring learning from one context \\nto another. How do I help reinforce this to keep \\nthem safe? \\nThis can be really difficult, but repetition is key! Try \\nto revisit the topic at different times – for instance, \\nremind them of the importance of passwords every \\ntime they go on their computer, and bring up key \\nterms such as ‘extremism’ throughout different \\ndiscussions. \\nHaving continuous open and honest communication \\nwith your young person is vitally important. Use the \\n‘Parent Toolkit’ resources to help you have some of \\nthese discussions. \\n48 49 '),\n",

Please remember the \\nyearly allowance can be different for each child and is determined by when the child becomes \\nof eligible age. \\nWe recommend you retain a record of the child level hours (per week and number of weeks) \\nthat you used to calculate an estimate, which will assist you later when you are required to \\nsubmit actuals. \\nPlease note that if a child has taken up a school place, even on a part-time basis, they are no \\nlonger eligible to claim EYFE. \\nLate returns will jeopardise prompt payment. Returns received after the deadline will be \\nactioned when all payments for prompt returns have been completed. \\nEstimates \\nIf you choose to submit an estimate claim, we pay 70% of the estimate up front and at the \\nbeginning of the term. This is followed by a reconciled balance paid based on the actuals \\nheadcount (child-level) return. Please take this into account in your cash flow forecast and \\nplanning of expenditure throughout each term. \\nTo claim an estimate, you submit the total number of EYFE hours expected to be \\nclaimed in Headcount week only. Our system will automatically calculate the estimated \\ntotal number of EYFE hours for the term. You must ensure that this figure is as accurate as \\npossible and this only applies to children who will be eligible for EYFE. \\nEstimate payments are based/paid on the school terms, which are: \\n• Spring and Summer terms: 12 weeks and \\n• Autumn term: 14 weeks. \\nIf you are open for more weeks do not amend the number of weeks at estimate stage. You \\nwill have the opportunity to amend when submitting actuals (child-level) data. Instead, \\ncalculate the correct figure to submit by using this method: \\nNumber of EYFE hours used in a week x number of weeks open in the term ÷ standard term \\nlength = figure to submit \\nFor example, you will be claiming 100 hours a week for 15 weeks in the summer term.  \\n100 hours x 15 weeks = 1500 hours \\n'),\n",

The ethnicity information and number of unfunded hours per \\nweek is particularly important for the Department for Education Early Years Census. You \\nmust remove any children who have left your setting, whether to go to school or for \\nother reasons.

They provide for checks on a \\nchild’s fitness for employment (byelaws 9 and 10) and for the issue of employment permits, setting \\nout the occupation in which a child may be employed and his hours of work (byelaws 8 -15).  \\nEmployers are obliged to notify local authorities of their child employees (byelaw 8).  \\n \\nThese byelaws are not a comprehensive statement of the law relating to the employment of children \\nand should be read in conjunction with other legislation relating to prohib ited occupations, hours of \\nwork and street trading in particular.   \\n \\nBy virtue of section 560 Education Act 1996, enactments relating to the prohibition or regulation of \\nthe employment of children do not apply to children undertaking work experience within the meaning \\nof the Act.  “Enactment” for this purpose includes byelaws having effect under an enactment, so \\nnothing in these Byelaws applies to a child’s work experience.   \\n \\nProhibited and permitted employment \\n \\nChildren under the age of 13 years are prohi bited from employment absolutely whilst those aged 13 \\nare limited to employment in the occupations listed at byelaw 5.  Children aged 14 or over are not \\nlimited in this way, but may only undertake light work (byelaw 4).

It is important that, in addition to reading \\nthe general information at the beginning, you read the right sections later in the booklet, \\nas the rules and procedure are slightly different. \\nIf you are applying for a place other than for the usual year of admission at that school, \\nthe appeal is classed as an ‘in-year’ appeal. You will therefore need to also refer to the \\nrelevant section for in-year appeals. The sections are as follows.\\n1.  Information which is general to all appeals\\n2.  Infant classes \\n3.

Information which is  \\ngeneral to all appeals\\n1.1  What is the ‘admission authority’?\\nThe admission authority is a term used throughout this booklet. It means the office responsible \\nfor deciding admissions to a particular school. Where the school is a Community School or a \\nVoluntary Controlled School, the admission authority will be the Admissions Office of the County \\nCouncil. There are two offices based in Horsham and Worthing.\\nWhere the school is a Voluntary Aided (church) School, Foundation School or Trust school, the \\nadmission authority will be the Governing Body for that school. Where the school is a Free \\nSchool or an Academy, the admission authority is the Academy Trust.\\n1.2  Do I have the right to appeal?\\nAll parents have the right to say which school they would like their child to attend. The admission \\nauthority must offer a place at that school unless there is a legal reason for refusing a place.\\nThe most common legal reason for not offering a place is that the school is full to its published \\nadmission number. Therefore, if more pupils were added to the numbers already admitted, it \\nwould adversely affect the resources at the school or the education of other children at the \\nschool. This might happen if a school is very popular and where space, equipment or staff would \\nbecome overstretched or where the quality of education would suffer if more children were \\nadmitted because of these pressures on staff or resources.\\nIf you cannot be offered a place at your preferred school, you have the right to appeal to an \\nIndependent Appeal Panel.  \\n1.3  How can I appeal?\\nIf you cannot be offered a place at your preferred school, and you wish to appeal against this \\ndecision, please complete the online appeal form by visiting westsussex.gov.uk and entering \\n‘how to appeal for a school place’ in the search box. If you do not have access to the internet, \\nyou can call the Contact Centre on 03330 142 903 and you will be sent a form to enable you to \\nappeal. If you are happy to accept the alternative place that you are offered, you do not need \\nto appeal. You can also accept the school that you are offered, and appeal for a place at your \\npreferred school at the same time.\\nIf you do wish to appeal, you will need to complete the form stating why you want your child to \\nattend that particular school.  Do not forget to fill in your address details as paperwork for the \\nappeal will need to be sent to you by  the Appeals Administrator in Legal Services at County Hall \\nin Chichester, and your details will not already be on file there. When returning the form, try to \\nsend all the information that you want the Panel to see. You may send documents to the Appeals '),\n",

The Panel will not contact people \\non your behalf, so if you want it to see papers such as a doctor’s report, you will need to get that \\nyourself and send it to the Appeals Administrator in good time before the hearing date. Make \\nsure that you submit your appeal form promptly to the Appeals Administrator. If you are late in \\nsubmitting your appeal, or send in extra papers very close to the hearing date, the date for your \\nappeal being heard could be delayed. \\n1.4  What happens after I have completed the Appeal Form?\\nOnce you have submitted the appeal form, a hearing will be arranged by the Appeals \\nAdministrator. Please bear in mind that it may be several weeks before your appeal can be heard.  \\nAppeals are not heard during school holidays. You should be notified of the date of your appeal \\nat least 10 school days in advance.  Sometimes you may be offered an appeal date with less \\nnotice. If that is the case, you will be asked if you wish the appeal to go ahead, or whether you \\nwould like a later date.\\nWhere possible, the hearing will take place within your area, usually at a neutral local venue. \\nSome appeals are conducted on Microsoft Teams and you will be advised in advance if this \\napplies to your appeal. All of the documents that you have provided will be sent in advance to \\nthe Panel and the admissions’ representative. The admissions’ representative will also provide \\na statement explaining their reasons for refusing a place at that school. That document will be \\nsent to you and the Panel. If you are appealing for a Community or Voluntary Controlled school, \\na map showing your house, and the location of your preferred school will also be sent. Maps are \\nnot always sent if you are appealing for other types of school.  \\nIf there is more than one appeal being heard, you will be given an appointment time. Where \\nthere is a plenary session, appointment times are scheduled at approximately 20 minute \\nintervals throughout the day. Where there is no plenary session arranged, usually in the event \\nof a small number of appeals, appointment times are scheduled at approximately 30 minute \\nintervals. This is to allow sufficient time for the school to present their case on an individual basis. \\nOccasionally some appeals take longer which may mean a delay in starting your appeal.  It may \\nbe difficult to re-arrange appointments but, if you are notified of an appointment you cannot \\nkeep, please contact the Appeals Administrator on 0330 2222 732 to see if it is possible to alter \\nthe arrangements. It will not usually be possible to change the day of the appeal, but it may be \\npossible to alter the timing of it.\\n1.5  What happens if I cannot or do not want to attend the Appeal?\\nIt is best for you to attend the hearing if you can, as you will be able to answer any questions that \\nthe Panel has and will also be able to ask questions yourself of the admissions’ representative.  \\nHowever, if it is not possible for you to attend, or you do not wish to attend the appeal hearing \\nin person, you can ask the Panel to consider your appeal by reading what you have sent in. This \\nis called ‘Written Representations. ’  Your case will be considered in the same way as at a hearing, \\nalthough obviously there will not be an opportunity to ask questions. The Panel will make a \\ndecision at the same time as it considers all the other appeals for that school.'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data-WordWizards/school_admission_appeals_guide.pdf', 'page': 4}, page_content='5\\n1.6  What is an ‘Independent Appeal Panel’?\\nThe Appeal Panel is not part of the admission authority or the school.  It is not bound by any \\narrangements or policies of the school or the admission authority. The decision of the Panel is \\nfinal and binding on all parties (parents, schools and the admission authority). Panel Members \\nare independent and are required to comply with the School Admission Appeals Code which \\nwas written by the Department for Education. Panel members must have attended training \\nbefore they can hear appeals.\\nThe Panel can allocate places for particular children at a school even though that year group is \\nfull, if there are convincing reasons to do so. \\n1.7  Who will be on the Independent Appeal Panel?\\nThe Independent Appeal Panel will usually have three people. There will be at least one person \\nwith experience in education from a school not connected with the area. There will also be at \\nleast one lay member – someone from the local community who has expressed a particular \\ninterest in admissions, or a governor from a different school. None of these people will be \\nconnected with the school you are appealing for or will have taken part in the admission \\narrangements for the school. Panel members also must not know you.\\nThe Panel will be assisted by a clerk who is legally trained and able to give advice and who will \\nensure that the Panel applies the law fairly and properly. The clerk will also take a brief note of \\nthe hearing (but not a verbatim report) to assist the Panel, and will record the decision and the \\nreasons for it. (If you wish to have a full note of the hearing, you will need to make this yourself.)  \\nTape recording of hearings is not normally permitted. The clerk will be responsible for informing \\nthe parents and the admission authority of the decision of the Panel.\\n1.8  What will happen at the hearing?\\nThe clerk will usually speak to you before the hearing and will invite you and the admissions’ \\nrepresentative to go into the hearing at the same time. If there are several appeals for the same \\nclass, the hearing is likely to take place in two parts, which may be on different days.\\nThe first part of the hearing is called a plenary session, and all parents are invited to attend. \\nSomeone from the school may also attend to answer questions. The admissions’ representative \\nwill present its case, explaining why the school is full and cannot take any more pupils into that \\nyear group. All parents and Panel members and the clerk will be invited to ask questions. After \\nthe questions, all parents and the admissions’ representative will leave the room whilst the Panel, \\nassisted by the clerk, makes its decision.  If the Panel decides that the year group is full, you will \\nbe asked to attend the second stage of the hearing. It is important that you try and attend both \\nparts of the hearing. The plenary session will be your only opportunity to ask questions of the \\nadmissions’ representative relating to the first part of the hearing.\\nThe second part of the hearing is just for your child. The clerk will again invite you and the \\nadmissions’ representative to go into the hearing. A representative from the school such as \\nthe head teacher or a governor may also attend. You will be asked to explain your reasons for '),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data-WordWizards/school_admission_appeals_guide.pdf', 'page': 5}, page_content='6\\nwanting a place at the school, and why you think the admission authority has made a mistake  \\nor applied the admissions policy unreasonably. You can be asked questions about this. (Please \\nnot\\ne that the admissions’ representative will not go over the information that was presented  \\nat the plenary session.) The admissions’ representative can sum up or add additional comments. \\nY\\nou can then add your final comments.  You and the admissions’ representative will then leave \\nthe hearing.  \\nWhen all the parents have made their own comments, the Panel will consider each case,  \\nand make its own decision.\\n1.9  Is the process the same where there are a small number of appeals?\\nIf there is only a small number of appeals for the same year group (usually up to three), you \\nwill be invited to attend just once. Your appeal will be just for your child and will last for \\napproximately 30 minutes. The admissions’ representative will outline its case first followed \\nby questions, and then you will be able to put forward your case and be asked questions. The \\nadmissions’ representative can then make any final comments before you are asked to make your \\nfinal comments. Again, the Panel will not make a decision until they have heard all the appeals \\nfor that year group.\\n1.10  Who can I bring to the Appeal?\\nOne or both parents can attend the appeal, and in addition, you are entitled to be accompanied \\nby a friend, relative or interpreter to assist you in presenting your case or to give you support. \\nIf you need an interpreter or signer, please contact the Appeals Administrator who will help \\nyou. It is not usual for your child to attend the hearing unless the appeal is for the 6th form. The \\nhearing will be as informal as possible. It is not usual to need legal representation, although you \\ncan seek legal advice if you wish. The school you are appealing for or a member of the admission \\nauthority cannot attend to assist you. However, you could ask a local politician or social worker \\nto attend provided that this will not lead to a conflict of interest.\\n1.11   My child’s name is on the waiting list. Does that affect my appeal?\\nNo, the waiting list is separate and does not affect the Panel’s decision. The admission authority \\nwill not tell the Panel what position your child is at on the waiting list.\\n1.12  What decisions can the Appeal Panel make?\\nThe Panel will hear all appeals for places at a particular school before any decisions are taken.  \\nTherefore the timing of your appeal will not affect the decision.\\nAs explained above, the hearing may have a plenary session and the Panel will decide at  \\nthat point whether the school is actually full, or whether it could take more children into  \\nthat year group. Where it agrees that the school is full, the next stage is to hear each parent’s \\ncase separ\\nately.'),\n",

The first stage is to decide whether the school is actually full. The Panel must \\nbe satisfied that if more children were given places, it would adversely affect the resources or \\neducation at the school.\\nWhere, either at the end of the plenary session, or at the end of stage one, the Panel is not \\nsatisfied that the admission authority’s case is a good one, it can decide that the admission of \\nmore children would be possible up to a particular limit. \\nIf the Panel makes this decision and the number that can be admitted is the same or more than \\nthe number of parents appealing, all will be offered places without needing to explain their own \\ncircumstances. However, if there are more people appealing than the Panel feel can be offered \\nplaces, they will need to hear each parent’s case. The Panel will then take into account the \\npublished admission arrangements and the individual parents’ circumstances and offer places \\nup to the number of places that it has decided can be filled before the school is full.  \\nIf the decision of the Panel is to agree with the admission authority’s case that the school is  \\nfull, (or after the Panel has added pupils at the end of stage one) it can still decide to admit  \\nmore pupils.  The Panel will make this decision based on the circumstances of each particular \\ncase\\n. If the Panel believes that there is a very sound and convincing reason for your child to  \\nget a place at the school even though it is full, it can tell the admission authority that it must  \\ngive your child a place.  \\nThat is why it is important that you must give a full account of your reasons for wanting your child \\nto go to that school. You will only get one chance to do this, so you must tell the Panel everything \\nabout your circumstances and why you want a place at that particular school, and make sure \\nthat you send in any documents to the Appeals Administrator in advance of your hearing.\\n1.13  How will I hear about the decision?\\nThe decisions about appeals for a particular school will be taken once all of those appeals have \\nbeen heard. They will be taken on the last day if the appeal hearings run for more than a day.  \\nYou will be able to telephone the Appeals Administrator on 0330 2222 732 on the working day \\nafter the last appeal to find out whether your appeal has been allowed or refused.  You will also \\nreceive a letter from the clerk about a week later explaining the decision.\\nThe Panel’s decision is final and is binding on the admission authority, the school and you.  \\nThere is no further right of appeal for parents.  You must therefore make the most of this one \\nappeal oppor\\ntunity.\\n1.14  What happens after the appeal?\\nIf your appeal is successful, the admission authority will let the school know, and you should \\ncontact the school to get details of the start date for your child.\\nIf your appeal is unsuccessful, and you have not accepted an alternative place, you can ring the \\nAdmissions’ Office in Horsham or Worthing to discuss the possibility of a place at another school.'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data-WordWizards/school_admission_appeals_guide.pdf', 'page': 7}, page_content='8\\nThere is no appeal against the decision of the Appeal Panel. However, if you think that the proper \\nprocedures were not followed during your appeal, or if you believe that the Panel has acted \\nunfairly, you should contact the Appeals Administrator who can give you details about making \\na complaint to the Local Government Ombudsman or to the Department for Education (DfE) in \\nthe case of an Academy. Neither the Ombudsman nor the DfE can overturn the decision of the \\nAppeal Panel, but if they agree with you that the hearing was not conducted properly, they can \\nrecommend that you are offered a fresh appeal with a new panel. \\n1.15  Can I appeal again if I haven’t got a place?\\nNo, you cannot appeal again for the same school, in the same academic year unless there is a \\nsignificant change to your own circumstances, or that of the school.\\n2. Infant classes\\n2.1.  Infant classes (classes where children are aged 7 or under)\\nThe law states (with a few exceptions which are listed in the School Admission Appeals Code) \\nthat all infant classes, (where children are aged 7 and under) should have no more than thirty \\npupils with a single teacher. Therefore if the class that your child would enter would exceed \\nthirty, the admission authority can refuse to allow your child a place.  You can still appeal to \\nthe Independent Appeal Panel, but only if you have grounds for believing that the admission \\nauthority has behaved unreasonably in a legal sense, or has not applied the rules correctly. The \\nPanel must consider whether the admission authority acted wholly irrationally in reaching the \\nconclusion that they did.  This is a very high threshold to meet.\\nIf the admission authority can show that they have behaved reasonably, and have applied the \\nadmissions rules correctly, and that they do not have space for an extra classroom and/or the \\nmoney for an extra teacher, the Panel cannot require the admission authority to offer a place.\\n2.2  Why are Infant Class Appeals different?\\nBecause the law states that infant classes should not normally have more than thirty pupils,  \\nthe Panel cannot increase the number of children in an infant class unless it is satisfied that  \\nthe admission authority has acted wrongly. The powers of the Panel to admit extra children  \\nare extremely limited where the school is organised into classes of thirty or will be arranged  \\nin classes of 30 in future years. This therefore means that very few appeals for infant classes  \\nare successful.'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data-WordWizards/school_admission_appeals_guide.pdf', 'page': 8}, page_content='9\\n2.3 What decisions can the Appeal Panel make?\\nThe Panel will hear all appeals for places at a particular school before any decisions are taken.  \\nTherefore the timing of your appeal will not affect the decision.\\nThe Panel may reject the case of the admission authority. However, it must be satisfied that \\nthe admission authority has behaved irrationally or unreasonably by not employing an extra \\nteacher, or providing an extra classroom, or both, or that it has made a mistake in the admission \\narrangements and that your child would have been admitted if that hadn’t happened, or that \\nthe admission arrangements were unlawful.\\nProvided that the admission authority has acted reasonably and properly it is unlikely that a \\nPanel will allow an appeal if to do so would mean that an infant class would have to admit more \\nthan thirty pupils.  It is therefore important that you establish whether this is the reason for your \\nchild being denied a place at the school.  \\n2.4  The school that I want my child to attend has fewer than 30 children  \\nin each class. Are the rules the same?\\nNo. Where the school is small, and the classes all have fewer than 30 children in them, the rules \\nrelating to infant classes do not apply.  The admission authority will be able to advise you in \\nmore detail, but basically, your appeal will follow the normal two-stage process that applies to all \\nother year groups.  The Panel will therefore have more discretion to admit a child to the school.\\nHowever, the Panel do take into account the effect of admissions as children move up through \\nthe infant year groups. For example, although admission to the reception class might not \\ncause prejudice (because there are fewer than 30 children) it could be an issue when that class \\nbecomes Year 1 or Year 2, particularly if there is vertical grouping in those years.\\n3. Church schools, foundation \\nschools, trust schools and \\nacademies\\n3.1  I would like my child to go to a Church School, Foundation School, Trust \\nSchool, Free School or Academy. Is the process the same?\\nIf you would like your child to attend one of the above types of school, you should obtain  \\na prospectus from that school, and look at the admissions criteria, as they are likely to be \\ndiffer\\nent from the admissions criteria for community schools. You will need to follow the \\ninstructions for applying carefully to make sure that you have filled out any extra forms  \\nthat may be required by the school.  '),\n",

During the normal \\nadmissions round (entry into Year R or Year 7), you will be notified by the County Council as \\nto whether you have been offered a place at one of your preference schools. Where an in-year \\napplication has been made and a school manages their own admissions (as per 1.1), the school \\nitself will notify you whether you have been offered a place.  \\n3.3  Can I appeal if I have not been offered a place at a Church School, \\nFoundation School, Trust School, Free School or  Academy?\\nYes, you can still appeal in the same way as described in the general information at the start of \\nthis booklet. The Appeals Panel is still independent, and is likely to consist of three people. The \\nPanel will be made up of the same categories of people, so there will be at least one person \\nexperienced in education and at least one lay person, who will be assisted by a clerk. However, \\nthe main difference is that someone from the school will present the information to the Panel, \\nrather than a representative from the County Council.\\n3.4  Where do I send the appeal form?\\nYou must send your completed appeal form, together with any other documents and reports \\nthat you want the Panel to read, to the Legal Services office in the same way as described above.  \\nThe hearing should take place at a local venue or the school.  \\n3.5  What happens after the hearing?\\nYou will be informed about the Panel’s decision in the same way as described above. If you have \\nnot been successful, you should contact the Admissions’ Office in Horsham or Worthing if you \\nstill need a school place for your child. You should also contact the school to see if your name \\ncan be placed onto a waiting list.\\n4. In-year appeals\\n4.1  I have moved into the area in the middle of a school year and the school I \\nwant my child to attend is already full. What can I do?\\nYou can apply for a place in the same way as has already been described. This is called an ‘in- year \\nappeal’ . It is likely that a special appeal date will need to be set up, or you may have your appeal \\nheard on the same day as appeals for other schools are heard. Your appeal will be heard in \\nprivate, and there will not be a group plenary session.'),\n",

It seeks to support you in gaining a basic \\nawareness of how to identify vulnerabilities in young people who might be at risk \\nof suicide when working with families. It will also enable you to learn how to \\nstart an open conversation about suicide, as this is one of the best ways that we \\nknow to prevent suicide. The aim of this course is to help you identify common \\nmyths about suicide and to provide up-to-date facts and understanding which \\nwill support you to improve your alertness to suicide when working with families. \\nIt will also support you in learning how to begin talking about suicide, which is \\nsomething that many professionals find challenging and hard to do, especially \\nwith young people and their parents or carers. You will also be directed to where \\nyou can access further help, support and resources. \\nIf you apply what you have learnt in this course, you will be able to: \\n• List the contributing factors of suicide. \\n• Recognise the signs that someone might be having thoughts of suicide. \\n• Initiate and engage someone in a short conversation about suicide. \\n• Correctly refer someone onto further help. \\nTarget audience and cost \\nChildminders, wraparound care - £40 \\nTraining provider \\nWest Sussex Safeguarding Children Partnership \\n2024/25 \\n18 September 2024, 15:00 – 17:00, Online \\nTo book, log onto Learning and Development Service an d search for the course \\ntitle.

To make the process as easy as possible, West Sussex County \\nCouncil encourages you to apply using the online application system at \\nwww.westsussex.gov.uk/admissions. \\nAll the information you need to help you through the process of applying for a school place is \\nin this booklet. Before completing your application, please take the time to read this \\nimportant information. The frequently asked questions pages and the admission \\narrangements for schools may help you decide on the best schools for your child. \\nBefore making your final decision about which schools to apply for, we would strongly \\nencourage         you to find out more about the schools you wish to consider. Many schools \\nhave enhanced their web presence and this can be a useful source of information for you. \\nDuring the autumn term, schools will be providing opportunities for prospective parents \\nto find out more about the school and we advise         you to contact schools to check their \\nparticular arrangements. \\nAlthough most children may secure a place at the first preference school, this is not always \\npossible if there are more applications for a school than there are places available. When this \\nhappens, places will be offered by applying the oversubscription criteria. You are strongly \\nadvised to provide preferences for three different schools you would like your child to attend \\nas this provides you with the best chance of getting your child into a school of your choice.  \\nWhere we are unable to meet one of your preferences, we will allocate a place at the \\ncatchment school where possible, or at the next nearest school to your home address where \\nthere is space if the catchment school is full. Remember if you want your child to attend their \\ncatchment school, you must include this as one of your preferences.  \\nIt is really important that you apply by the national deadline of Wednesday 15 January \\n2025. Applying after this deadline may significantly affect the school that can be offered. \\nI wish your son or daughter the very best for when they start at their new school. \\n \\n  \\nClaire Hayes \\nAssistant Director of Education and Skills \\n'),\n",

SIFs can be found in Appendix 2 of this booklet and can be obtained from the \\nschool concerned. \\nPoints to consider before submitting your three preferences \\n• Make sure you use all three of your preferences wisely, be realistic and apply on \\ntime. School places are allocated according to the published oversubscription \\ncriteria for each school so study these carefully. This can include criteria such as \\nwhether you live in the catchment area, whether there are siblings already at the \\nschool and the distance you live from the school. You have a higher priority for \\nyour catchment school. If you make a preference for an oversubscribed school, the \\nfurther away you live the less likely you are to be offered a place.  \\n• Personal circumstances, such as childcare arrangements, are not part of the \\noversubscription criteria for any school and will not be taken into consideration. \\nYou are strongly encouraged to include your catchment school as one of your \\nthree preferences. If you wish your child to be considered for a place at their \\ncatchment school you must include this as one of your three preferences.

If the school that should have been offered was full at allocation an \\nalternative will be offered and this may be further away. \\nShared residency \\nThe Pupil Admissions Team can only use one address for the purpose of allocating a \\nschool place. The address for the application is the one held on our records as being the \\naddress for your child. If your child regularly stays overnight with another parent or \\nrelative on a shared residency basis and therefore potentially has more than one \\naddress, you must confirm this in writing after making your application online. You \\nshould give both addresses and details of your child’s living arrangements and state \\nwhich address you believe should be used for the application i.e. your child’s main \\naddress. We may contact you for further supporting evidence and this could include \\ndocumentation such as a: council tax bill, medical card, utility bill, bank statement or \\nchild benefit documentation. Additional enquiries may also be made where necessary. \\nPriority for your preferences will be decided according to the address which the Pupil \\nAdmissions Team determines as your child’s main address. Parents should note that \\novernight stays relating to childcare arrangements are rarely considered to be a formal \\n‘shared residency‘ and priority will not be given from a relative/carer’s address in these \\ncircumstances. Parents should submit details of their child’s shared residency by \\ncovering letter addressed to the Pupil Admissions Team. \\nChildren coming from abroad during the normal admission round \\nIf you are moving from abroad, or from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, you can make \\nan application direct to West Sussex County Council if you have a West Sussex address. \\nIf a child is coming from abroad to the UK certain conditions must be met. Before applying \\nfor a state-funded school place it is the parent’s responsibility to ensure that they and their \\nchild have a right of abode in the UK or that the conditions of their immigration status \\notherwise permit them to access a state-funded school.

However, the Team is unable to: \\n• offer opinions on schools’ suitability and performance; \\n• arrange visits to schools; \\n• allocate places outside West Sussex County Council’s criteria or take account of \\npersonal circumstances, outside of exceptional and compelling cases; \\n• change a child’s details (name or address) without written confirmation, by letter or \\nemail, and acceptable supporting documentation where appropriate; \\n• investigate anonymous allegations regarding false addresses without sufficient \\ninformation. West Sussex County Council does treat the issue of using a false \\naddress very seriously and any correspondence of this nature is dealt with \\nconfidentially. \\nIf you are dissatisfied with the service of the Pupil Admissions Team, in the first instance \\nplease write to the Pupil Admissions Manager for the area, see page 98 and 100. \\nComplaints about schools should be referred to the headteacher or the school’s \\nGoverning Body. \\nHow likely is it that my preference will be met? \\nPlease see the section on using your three preferences wisely and being realistic (under \\n‘Points to consider before submitting your three preferences’) on page 6-8. The less \\npriority you have under a school’s oversubscription criteria the less likely you are to be \\noffered a place if that school has more applications than places. For the 2023 starting \\nschool round 91.6% of parents who applied on time were offered their preferred school \\nand 98.6% were offered one of their three preferred schools. \\n  '),\n",

This is only a guide because patterns of parental preference and the number \\nof pupils in the area vary from year to year. The outcome of your application cannot be \\nguaranteed. If you want further information about the previous patterns of admission to \\nyour preferred schools, please contact the Pupil Admissions Team. \\nWhere can I find out information about schools? \\nIt is important that you do not base your preferences on other people’s opinions. Each \\nschool has a prospectus and website which include details of the school’s policies, \\nuniform, the curriculum and teaching methods, term dates and school times as well as \\nother helpful information. You can obtain a copy of the prospectus from the school and \\nyou are welcome to make an appointment to visit the school. School websites can be \\naccessed through the West Sussex County Council website. You can find links to school \\nOFSTED reports and Department for Education performance tables by going to \\nGovernment website. Thi s  information should also be available from the school or your \\nlocal library. \\nSchools m ay invite you to attend an open session and this invitation or receipt of a \\nprospectus should not be seen as an offer of a school place as all offers are made \\nthrough the Local Authority. Headteachers may confirm that they would be happy to \\nhave your child in their school but again this is not an offer because all applications are \\nsubject to the admission criteria. \\nAre West Sussex Infant and Junior Schools linked? \\nWest Sussex infant and junior schools are linked (see the lists on pages 51 and 82). If a \\nstarting school child will have a sibling at the linked junior school in September 2025, \\nthen the starting school child has sibling priority for the infant school. Please note that it \\nis the parent’s responsibility to tell the Pupil Admissions Team about sibling links in their \\napplication. When making the infant school application online tick the box ‘Sibling will \\nattend this school or the linked junior school in September 2025 and complete the \\nrelevant section. \\nPlease note that if you are applying for a Year 3 place for one child at the linked junior \\ns\\nchool and a Reception place for a sibling at the linked infant school you must still advise \\nus of the sibling link on your younger child’s application even though an offer for the Year \\n3 place will not yet be confirmed. The Pupil Admissions Team will then check your \\napplications and ensure that the correct priority is given. If you do not advise us of the \\nsibling link on your application it may not be given and your younger child will be \\ndisadvantaged. If you require any clarification on the process please contact the Pupil \\nAdmissions Team who will be happy to advise you. \\nCan I ask for my child to go to any primary school in West Sussex? \\nYou can express a preference for any of the primary schools listed. West Sussex County \\nCouncil makes every effort to meet parental preference but some schools receive more \\napplications than the number of places available. When this happens, the \\noversubscription criteria are used to decide which children are offered a place. Please \\nalso see the answer to the question ‘How likely is it that my preference will be met?’ \\nabove for further information, and advice on using your three preferences wisely and \\nbeing realistic, on pages 6-8. \\n '),\n",

You can check your catchment school by  entering your postcode \\non our website. \\nMany ch urch  voluntary aided schools, foundation schools, free schools and academies \\nalso have catchment areas. In the case of church voluntary aided schools, the catchment \\narea may be defined in terms of parishes or deaneries while others may serve an even \\nwider area. For these schools, full details can be found in the school’s published \\nadmission arrangements on their website. Decisions to offer a place at these schools are \\nmade by the Governing Body or Academy Trust. \\nIf you apply for a place for your child at a community or controlled school that is not \\nthe catchment school for your address, you should note the following: \\n• the Council will not provide assistance with travel or related expenses to the school; \\n• it is less likely that places will be available at oversubscribed schools for any \\nbrothers or sisters, should you wish them to attend at a later date; \\n• the tie break for oversubscribed schools, within any oversubscription \\ncategory, is the straight line distance from home to school. \\nCan I defer my child’s start at school? \\nBy law, children must start their full-time education in the term following their fifth \\nbirthday. In West Sussex your child may start either full or part-time in the September \\nfollowing their fourth birthday. All applicants seeking admission during the academic year \\ncommencing in September 2025 must apply by the deadline 15 January 2025. \\nWhen you have received the offer of a school place, you may wish to take the \\noppo\\nrtunity to discuss the school’s induction arrangements and your child’s start date \\nwith the school. You can defer admission until the start of the spring or summer term so \\nlong as your child has not reached compulsory school age. However, you must inform \\nthe school of this decision. \\nYou may feel that starting school in September 2025 is too early for your child and would \\nprefer them to remain at a pre-school group, playgroup or in a nursery school. Should \\nyour child attend school part-time as well as a nursery or playgroup part-time, your \\nNursery Education Grant funding will automatically transfer to the school. This means \\nyou will have to pay the full fees for the amount of time your child attends nursery, pre-\\nschool or playgroup. \\nShould you choose to defer your child’s start until the term following their fifth birthday; \\nthe school you have been offered will hold your child’s school place provided your child is \\nstill joining the school in the reception year. If your child was born between 1 April 2021 \\nand 31 August 2021 you can decide not to take up a school place until September 2025; \\nhowever a place will not be held in a Reception class and in most cases your child may \\nneed to join Year 1 upon their admission to school. Parents wishing to defer to Year 1 \\nmust approach the Pupil Admission Team in May 2025 to apply for a place but should be \\naware that a place may not be available in a local school.

However, some parents wish to request a delayed admission and apply to start \\nschool in September 2026. \\nHowever, there is still no automatic right to a child being able to start in reception class \\nwhere that is not their normal age group. Parents therefore, should consider whether to \\nrequest admission out of the normal year group at all their preferred schools, rather than \\njust their first preference school. \\nThe decision lies with the relevant admission authority. For community and controlled \\nschools this is West Sussex County Council, for an academy it is the academy trust and \\nfor a foundation or voluntary aided school it is the governing body. In order for the \\nCouncil to make a decision, parents should complete the delayed entry application form \\nbelow before the closing date of 15 January 2025, and include any available evidence \\nfrom professionals detailing why there is a need for their child to start in the Reception \\nclass the following year. \\nIf a parent is applying for a school for which the Council is not the admissions authority \\nthey must contact the school direct. If the request is agreed, evidence from the school at \\nthe time of application will be required. One admission authority cannot be required to \\nhonor a decision made by another admission authority on admission out of the normal \\nage group. \\nYou must also complete an application, by 15 January 2025, for the admission of your \\nchild for September 2025. This will ensure that you have secured a school place for \\nSeptember 2025, which can be released later if the decision is made for your child to \\ndelay entry until 2026. \\nIf your application for delayed entry is agreed your child will not be allocated a place at a \\nschool for 2025 (or any place already offered will be released) and you will need to make \\na fresh application for a school place with those children starting school in September \\n2026. Parents should note that it will not be possible to apply online for a school place \\noutside of your child’s normal year of entry and you will need to contact the Pupil \\nAdmissions Team to request a paper application form in the Autumn Term 2025. The \\napplication will be considered in line with the published admission arrangements for the \\nschool alongside all other applications for September 2026. \\nIf your application for delayed entry is refused, your child must either take up the place \\nthey have been offered for 2025 by the start of the summer term 2026 or you must \\nmake an application for a Year 1 place in September 2026.

Please do not list Elective Home Education as a preference on an \\napplication as it will be disregarded and a school place offered. Please note that if you \\nchoose to educate your child yourself you do not receive any additional priority for a \\nschool place should you wish to apply at a later date. \\nInformation regarding home education is available from West Sussex County Council’s \\nElective Home Education Team on 0330 222 3300 or by e-mailing ehe@westsussex.gov.uk.

Your child \\nwill not then be offered a state-funded school place. If your application to an \\nindependent school is still being considered and a place is yet to be formally offered, we \\nrecommend that you make an application online expressing three preferences for \\nmaintained schools in order to ensure your child has a school place for September 2025. \\nIf you are uncertain about your pending application to an independent school and would \\nlike further advice on making your application, please contact the Pupil Admissions Team \\nfor guidance. Please do not list an independent school as a preference on an application \\nas it will be disregarded and a state school place offered. \\nCan I change my preference? \\nBefore the national closing date of 15 January 2025 you can amend your preferences \\nby logging back into your online application. You must re-submit your application \\nevery time you click edit your child’s details or you make a change to your \\npreferences. Only your last submitted preferences, prior to the deadline, will be \\nconsidered in the allocation. \\nAfter the deadline has passed you cannot change your preferences unless there is a \\ngen\\nuine unforeseeable reason for you needing to do so, for example, if a sibling has \\nmoved schools. Evidence of the change will be required before the processing deadline of \\n12 February 2025 for the Pupil Admissions Team to amend your preferences and any \\nother relevant information linked to your application. \\nParents wishing to change their preferences after the deadline without a genuine \\nunforeseeable reason cannot submit new preferences until after the allocation date. At \\nthat time parents should complete a new application through our website. Changes of \\npreference in this instance are outside the normal admissions round, and along with late \\napplications, will not be processed until after 14 May 2025. \\nHow will I hear the outcome of my application? \\nIf you apply on or before 12 February 2025, and supply an email address, you will be \\nsent an email on allocation day 16 April 2025 to confirm the outcome of your application. \\nIt is therefore important that you use an email account you will have access to on \\nallocation day. Parents who do not supply an email address will receive a letter, which is \\nsent by 2nd class post on allocation day, with the outcome of their application. \\nIf you apply on or after 13 February 2025 you will be notified of the outcome of your \\napplication after 14 May 2025. \\nParents will not be notified of the outcome of their application over the telephone and \\napplicants unable to access email accounts used in an application must request their \\nallocation result be issued by letter which will be sent by 2nd class post. \\nWhat happens after allocation? \\nThe majority of parents in West Sussex will receive an offer of a school place at a school \\nthey expressed a preference for. For children starting school for the first time, the school \\noffered will ask you to accept the place and provide a copy of your council tax bill as \\nproof of your address and a copy of the birth certificate. Accepting the place offered \\ndoes not affect your right of appeal or to be on the waiting list for any school '),\n",

If your address has or will be changing you must notify the \\nPupil Admissions Team without delay. The Headteacher of the school your child has been \\nallocated will contact you to confirm the school’s induction arrangements. \\nDifferent arrangements may apply for parents being offered school places in other Local \\nAuthority areas. If you have been offered a school in another Local Authority area you \\nshould contact the school to confirm the necessary arrangements for entry to the school. \\nParents wishing to add or change preferences on their application can do so after the \\nallocation date by submitting either an electronic late application form through our \\nwebsite or by completing a paper form. When doing so parents should clarify the order of \\nthe new preferences and any previous ones. Changes of preference in this instance are \\noutside the normal admissions round, and along with late applications, will not be \\nprocessed until after 14 May 2025. \\nWhat can I do if I am not offered a place at the school I wanted? \\nIf we cannot offer your child a place at any of your preferred schools, we will offer a \\nplace at your catchment school (if you have one) if availability allows or, if your \\ncatchment school is full, you will be offered a place at the nearest school to your home \\naddress with a place available. (This only applies to children resident in West Sussex. If \\nyou live in another Local Authority’s area they will offer you a place at one of their \\nschools, if your preferences cannot be met). For this reason we always advise parents to \\ninclude their child’s catchment school as one of their three preferences. If you are \\nunhappy with the school you have been offered the Pupil Admissions Team can tell you \\nwhich alternative schools have places available but you should be aware these may be \\nfurther from your home than the offer you currently have. Please note that we have a \\nstatutory obligation to offer your child a school place and, therefore, we will not \\nwithdraw the place offered until we receive written confirmation, by letter or email, of \\nthe alternative arrangements you have made for your child’s education once they reach \\nstatutory school age. \\nCan I appeal? \\nYou have the right to appeal against the decision not to offer a place at any of your \\npreferred schools. All appeals are heard by an independent panel. If you have been \\nrefused a place in West Sussex at your preferred school(s) in writing, you can access an \\nonline appeal form and details of the appeals process at . If you require a paper form \\nyou can ring 03330 142 903 to request one. If you decide to appeal, you will receive \\nadvance notice of the hearing date. You will be invited to attend the appeal and you may \\ntake someone with you for support. The hearing will be conducted as informally as \\npossible and you will have the opportunity to put forward your case and ask questions. \\nFor Reception, Year 1 and Year 2, the right of appeal is restricted by law due to Infant \\nClass Size legislation. Where classes are organised in these year groups in classes of 30 \\npupils, you could only be successful if you could prove that: \\na) the admission arrangements were incorrectly applied in your case and your child \\nshould have been offered a place or \\nb) the child would have been offered a place if the arrangements had not been \\ncontrary to mandatory provisions in the School Admissions Code or the law or \\nc) the admission authority acted unreasonably – that is, the decision made was \\nperverse and would not have been made by a reasonable authority. \\nIf your appeal is refused, the Local Authority or Admissions Authority (at an academy, '),\n",

If \\nyou were refused a school place outside of West Sussex then you need to contact the \\nAdmissions Authority for the school refused for information on their appeal process. \\nWill my child’s name be added to the waiting list? \\nIf your child was refused a place in writing at a West Sussex school they will automatically \\nbe added to the waiting list for that school. \\nWaiting lists are set-u p 20 school days after the allocation date and for community and \\ncontrolled schools will be held until the end of the academic year applied for. If you wish \\nyour child to be on the waiting list for a community or controlled school for the following \\nacademic year then you must submit a new application after 20 May of the academic \\nyear originally applied for. For example, if you apply for Year R at a community or \\ncontrolled school for September 2025, unless offered a place, your child would remain on \\nthe Year R waiting list until July 2026. If you wish your child to be on the waiting list for \\nYear 1 you must make an In Year application for a Year 1 place after 20 May 2026. \\nApplications for September are processed from 1 June. It is the parent’s responsibility to \\nmake an application for community and controlled schools the following academic year – \\nreminders will not be sent. For community and controlled schools you must make a new \\napplication for each academic year you wish your child to remain on the waiting list as \\nthis triggers a new right of appeal for the new year group. If you have been refused a \\nplace at an Academy, Church Aided or Free School the waiting list will be held by the \\nAdmissions Team until September, when it will be passed to the school. From September \\nyou should contact the school directly regarding their management of the list. If you \\nwere refused a school place outside of West Sussex you need to contact the Admission \\nAuthority for the school refused for information on their waiting list procedure. \\nAll waiting lists are held in accordance with the School Admissions Code as required by \\nt\\nhe Department for Education. For example waiting lists must reflect the over-\\nsubscription criteria used at allocation and it is prohibited to prioritise lists using a date \\norder. The oversubscription criteria for all Community and Controlled schools in West \\nSussex are shown on page 83. The oversubscription criteria for church aided and \\nfoundation schools and academies in West Sussex are shown in Appendix 1 of this \\nbooklet and are also available on the schools’ websites or from the schools. For \\nCommunity and Controlled schools, within each criterion waiting list positions are ordered \\nby straight line distance to the school, the nearest having higher priority. If a place \\nbecomes available following the allocation it will be offered to the child at the top of the \\nwaiting list at that time. \\nWhat happens if my child can be offered a place from the waiting list? \\nIf a place becomes available from a waiting list, you will be contacted using the \\ninformation in your application. If we do not receive a reply from you within 5 working \\ndays of trying to contact you, your child’s name will be removed from the waiting list and \\nthe place will be reallocated to the next child on that list. You may wish to provide \\nadditional contact information in order to ensure you can be contacted promptly in the \\nevent of a place becoming available. When doing so please ensure you consider your \\naccess to that route of contact i.e. can you access your emails whilst on holiday. '),\n",

(Where the tie-break produces two \\nor more equal distances the deadlock is broken by random allocation.) \\n• All distances are measured by a straight line from the school to the child’s home \\naddress, \\nusing Ordnance Survey data within the curtilage of the property. \\n• Where priority is given for a sibling, brothers or sisters may be half or step-\\nsiblings (by marriage or co-habitation) or foster siblings but must be living \\npermanently at the same address. \\n• West Sussex County Council only gives sibling priority if the sibling will be at the \\nschool at the time of application and will still be in the school at the time of \\nadmission; or if the sibling will be attending the linked junior school when the child \\nstarts (see pages 49 and 89 for the lists of linked schools). Please note it is the \\nparent’s responsibility to tell the Pupil Admissions Team about sibling \\nlinks in their application. \\nSiblings of children who have been refused a place at their catchment school \\nbecause the school was oversubscribed at the point of application will be treated \\nas living in the catchment area for the allocated school when they apply for \\nstarting school. This will only apply if an application was made for the catchment \\nschool and the place refused in writing.

Before applying for a state-funded school place it is the parent’s \\nresponsibility to ensure that they and their child have a right of abode in the UK or that \\nthe conditions of their immigration status otherwise permit them to access a state-\\nfunded school. You must provide evidence that your child is arriving in the UK within four \\nweeks of the application (usually a copy of your child’s flight ticket) and the address \\nwhere they will be living, if known. If a UK address is not provided the child’s current \\naddress abroad will be used which will generally give the lowest priority for a school \\nplace. All required evidence must accompany the application. Please do not send original \\ndocuments as these cannot be returned. If an offer is made and it transpires that these \\nconditions have not been met the offer will be withdrawn. \\nVulnerable Children – In acc ordance with the School Admissions Code, a Fair Access \\nProtocol exists to ensure that un-placed children, especially the most vulnerable, for \\nexample children who are homeless or children who are carers, are offered a place at a \\nsuitable school as quickly as possible. You will be contacted after you have returned an \\napplication form if your application is to be processed under the Fair Access Protocol. \\nLooked Afte r Children and Previously Looked After Children - It should be noted \\nthat the School Admissions Code 2021 differentiates between a looked after child and a \\npreviously looked after child. A local authority has the power to direct a maintained \\nschool to admit a looked after child, even when the school is full. This is not the case \\nwith a previously looked after child, although previously looked after children do receive \\npriority under the oversubscription criteria. \\nInfant Class Size Legislation - Legisl ation relating to Infant Class Sizes must be adhered \\nto. This means that classes for Reception, Year 1 and 2 must not contain more than 30 \\npupils with one teacher. In allocating places in these year  groups the Admission Authority \\nmust comply with this legislation as it is a statutory requirement and every effort must be \\nmade to keep over-sized classes to a minimum.

They are set up by sponsors from \\nbusiness, faith or voluntary groups in partnership with the Department for Education \\n(DfE) and the Local Authority. Academies are run by their own academy trust, which sets \\nthe admissions criteria and makes admissions decisions. \\nAdmission Authority \\nThe body that decides which children can attend a school, based  on their Admission \\nPolicy. For community and voluntary controlled schools this is the Local Authority. For \\nacademies, church voluntary aided schools, foundation schools and free schools, it is the \\nGoverning Body or Academy Trust. \\nBack-classing \\nThe Department for Education expects pupils to be educated in their correct \\nchronological year group. A back-classing arrangement is when a child who has already \\nbeen in receipt of education repeats an academic year and is therefore educated outside \\nof their chronological year group. This is an exceptional arrangement and applications \\nmust be supported by the current or most recent school. \\nCatchment School \\nThe school(s) that serve a specific area or address. \\nChildren of Staff \\nPriority will now be applied to children of school staff in either or both of the \\nfollowing circumstances (following section 1.39 of the School Admissions Code). \\n• Where the member of staff has been employed at the school for two or more \\nyears at the time which the admission to the school is made, and/or \\n• the member of staff is recruited to fill a vacant post for which there is a \\ndemonstrable skill shortage. \\nChurch Voluntary Aided School \\nChurch voluntary aided schools are schools with a religious character which are run by \\ntheir own Governing Body, which sets the admissions criteria and makes admissions \\ndecisions. They are maintained by the Local Authority but the governing body contributes \\nto building and maintenance costs. \\nCommunity School \\nA community school is one which is funded and run by the Local Authority, who set \\nthe admissions criteria and makes decisions. The school is maintained by the Local \\nAuthority. '),\n",
